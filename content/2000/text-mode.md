so, last night, i decided to return to an oooooollldd project of mine. but... it's also the highest-bandwidth use of this server. so, to avoid killing every other site sharing the dsl with it, i opted to host the graphics on a separate server (my desktop machine, with speedy apartment ethernet.)

unfortunately, i have zero disk space. i don't have enough to rebuild the linux kernel, which i need to do to enable firewalling. i want to have firewalling enabled so i can safely allow traffic only to the web and ssh ports (and chargen, for good measure, tee hee!)- blocking off X and printers from malicious demons and such.

so now i'm running high-res text mode. 100x40 with an 85hz refresh rate. aww yeah baby.

but it has put a crimp in development of other cool projects, like MK:A.

still.. i'm kinda proud of the setup ;)
