I am very tired. I am also very excited about the new Leilani photoblog . . . once Scott gets it more set up, I am going to import all the leilani-related posts from my kmorg blog . . .

I'm also going to keep working on the more static elements of the page: the gallery page (for all the 'best' photos), the timeline page (which will eventually be divided by month, with appropriate photos linked), and of course the links page (for all those cool online baby resources we've stumbled across).

And then, you know, I'll work on my page. Eventually. Once my job situation stabilizes. If that ever happens.

Grr.
