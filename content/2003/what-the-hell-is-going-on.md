Okay, first [Microsoft announced](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itcommunity/chats/trans/ie/ie0507.asp) that it would no longer be developing a stand-alone version of Internet Explorer, and then [AOL announced](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2003c.html#t20030715) that they will no longer be developing Netscape.  
  
Did the two biggest browsers on the market really just halt development? What's this going to mean? Everyone's still debating over what it means that IE will be frozen at version 6 for the next couple years, this just makes things even more unclear.  
  
I'd like to think (as someone who is concerned about web standards) that this will motivate people to switch to browsers that support standards, such as [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/) or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/). But the reality, I think, is that IE6 will continue to dominate the browser world.
