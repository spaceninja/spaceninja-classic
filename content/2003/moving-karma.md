We helped Daniel load up a moving van for his drive up to Kirkland tomorrow. He owns the heaviest TV I've ever seen. It's one of those really nice flatscreen HDTVs, but it seems to be carved out of a block of solid lead. It took three guys to wrestle (sometimes literally) the beast down two flights of stairs, out the hall, down another set of steps and up the ramp into the truck.  
  
The rest of his stuff wasn't too bad though, and the truck wasn't even half full when we were done loading it. Then Daniel served us all a dinner of Eggplant Parmesian, followed by all of us heading over to Perry's on Fremont for dessert. Everyone ordered something different, and we actually just passed the plates around, so everyone could try a bite of everything. Zima definitely won, with some sort of huge mocha cheesecake with caramel toppings and sliced bananas.  
  
Eric and Zima departed to check out a concert, and the rest of us retired back to Daniel's kitchen for a final game of Settlers of Catan (at least until Eric and I buy our copies of the game for Saturday). It was a very good match, but Daniel dominated us all again. (Despite his assurances that it was mostly luck, the fact that he's won 3 of 4 games we've played with him speaks volumes.) If I had known Daniel had access to the game, I would have had him bring it over earlier. Still, it's nice to have a game everyone is into, to promote my efforts to turn one of our weekly get-togethers into game night. Next game on the list: [Zombies!!!](http://www.kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/12586)!
