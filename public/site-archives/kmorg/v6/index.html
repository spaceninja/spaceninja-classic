This page came online in early 2005 to show that Miles was planning to build a new KMorg.

<h2>KMorg is coming back!</h2>

<p>That's right! Everyone's favorite weblog community is going to be
back on top before long. Keep your eyes on this domain for further news.</p>

<p><strong>Looking for your old journal?</strong> You can download it from the <a href="http://killingmachines.spaceninja.com/">KillingMachines archive site</a>.</p>

<h3>Who?</h3>

<p>The new development team has been assembled, and is quickly getting
up to steam. We wish to remain anonymous for now, so until our real
names are released, you can direct your attention to our proud leader,
Gary Dirin. Returning from the dead to lead his people out of the vast
wasteland that is LiveJournal and Blogger, he will bring you to a
glorious future!</p>

<p>You can send emails to garydirin (at) killingmachines.org.</p>

<h3>What?</h3>

<p>KillingMachines was an online community with state-of-the-art
weblogging features, such as subdomains and "skinning" (the ability to
apply your own design to your weblog). It also featured forums and a
messaging system. The new KMorg is still on the drawing board, so we're
not commiting to any specific features just yet, but rest assured that
we want the best for the community, and we're not going to hamstring it
by cutting out the important stuff.</p>

<h3>When?</h3>

<p>There is no public timeline at this point, though we may post one in the future.</p>

<h3>Where?</h3>

<p>Right here at killingmachines.org of course!</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Because it's there.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>KMorg is going to be completely re-engineered from the ground up, and rebuilt using the powerful <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby On Rails</a> framework. More details will come in the future.</p>
