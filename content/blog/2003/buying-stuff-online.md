I love buying things online. In the next week, I should have my copy of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs on DVD, the graphic novel of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a copy of half-life (the first one), and of course, the Matrix xbox game. I love getting things in the mail. It's a very exciting time!
