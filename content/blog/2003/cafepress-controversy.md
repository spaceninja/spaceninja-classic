I've had a few people forward me a link to [This Page](http://www.giveneyestosee.com/say-no-to-cafepress/), where the author pulls some clauses out of the new CafePress TOS agreement, and interprets them to mean that if you use cafepress you give up rights to your images.

To anyone who has read this page and is taking this guy seriously, do yourself a favor and go read the [New TOS Agreement](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/info/help/new_memberagreement.aspx), and then go read the [response emails](http://giveneyestosee.com/say-no-to-cafepress/index2.html) CafePress has sent the guy.

The author of the page is **grossly** misinterpreting the contract. Specifically, he reads section 6.1 and 6.2 as meaning that you give up all rights to your artwork. It does not mean this. 6.1 refers to the fact that you cannot trademark or copyright cafepress.com and the services provided. 6.2 gives cafepress.com the right to use your images to do what you've asked them to do. That's all.

Now, don't get me wrong. There's plenty in the new TOS to be upset about, such as the clause where they say they will charge a 5% transaction fee on every commission, or the fact that if you don't meet their minimum sales quote in 180 days, they claim your profit for their own. But this guy is seeing some problems that don't exist.

Now, if he would add in a clause about their recent decision to stop supporting GIF files, I might be willing to use one of the ugly banners he's drawn up to support his reactionary cause.

Still, even given the small problems I've had with them, I find cafepress to be, on the whole, an acceptable service with no real competitors. For a minimum amount of work, I get (what feels like) free money sent to me every couple of months.
