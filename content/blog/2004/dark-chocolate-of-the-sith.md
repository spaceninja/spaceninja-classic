We had Scott'n'Annie over tonight for one last dinner before they move up North. To celebrate, I finally made a cake with the Darth Vader pan our neighbor gave me a few months ago. It was a chocolate layer cake with raspberry sauce.

Some Notes: I opted to forgo icing due to A) lack of time and B) desire to keep Darth Vader's visage clear and easily recognizable. The cake came out a little crumbly on the "face" due to insufficient buttering/flouring of the pan, and because I think I over-cooked it a little.

But everyone said other than being a little dry, it was pretty good. And evil.
