At 6:15 tonight, Annie and I are getting on a train headed North to her parent's house. We're going to stay there for Thanksgiving and come back Monday night. I'm looking forward to it. I haven't really be able to relax lately because we've been doing so much stuff with moving, unpacking, and working at my parent's house.

I just finished reading the first [Harry Potter](http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/) book, and I'm making headway on the second. Annie's going to finish reading the first one on the train, and then we'll go see the movie together! Now that I've read the book, I understand why people were so excited about the movie. So many scenes in the book just seem to have been created to be filmed. I've heard the Quidditch match is fantastic, so I'm really looking forward to that.

It's a good thing I have Harry Potter to distract me from noticing that [Lord of the Rings](http://www.lordoftherings.net/) opens on December 19th.
