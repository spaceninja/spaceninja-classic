[![Project Gotham Racing 3 real-life comparison](/images/pgr3compare.jpg)](http://www.gamebrink.com/?news=161)

Project Gotham Racing 3 looks very realistic. Enough so that the screenshot of the game and the photo of the real-life location are not easy to tell apart. If you look closely, you can see some things that the xbox doesn't handle very well, like power lines and trees, but the windows are absolutely incredible - down to the lights in the offices behind the windows that aren't covered in advertisements. You can see a couple other examples over at [Gamebrink](http://www.gamebrink.com/?news=161).
