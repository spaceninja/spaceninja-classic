This design came online in September of 2001, and was the default design for my blog for 3 years. It stayed up through several software changes, from FCS to F5k to Movable Type to Wordpress. Through that time it was tweaked and improved with better spacing and padding, and also converted from a table-based layout to CSS. All good things must pass, though, and in September of 2004, this design was retired.

<br>Background information: About two weeks ago, I called Qwest and
ordered phone service for our new house. At the same time, I ordered
DSL. The guy took my information, and then completely ignored it and
placed an order for MSN DSL. We moved in and discovered a dead phone
jack, and Qwest saying they might not make my DSL due date (December
6). Then I got my first phone bill, which was for $72, which is
shockingly high, since we don't have long distance. So today I called
up Qwest with the intention of addressing the following problems:
</p><li>Removing extra items from my phone bill.
</li><li>Getting the dead phone jack fixed.
</li><li>Checking up on my DSL order.

<p><b>Qwest Rep #1 (male, somewhat helpful):</b> Two of the extra
services on your bill you can have removed no problem. The third one:
"Toll Restriction Service, Individual &amp; Key Lines," you cannot.
That is the $2 that we charge you every month for not having long
distance service. We will only stop charging you that if you pay the
$100 deposit to turn on long-distance service. Now I'll transfer you to
the service-removal department.
</p><p><b>Qwest Rep #2 (female, helpful):</b> I can remove Call
Rejection and Call Waiting if you want, but you get them for free. The
bill you got is an error. Since you have DSL service, you get Call
Rejection, Call Waiting and Caller ID for free, which the first
salesman you talked to failed to mention. Now I'll transfer you to the
bill-sending department... ask for an updated bill.
</p><p><b>Qwest Rep #3 (female, irritated):</b> No, I can't send you a
new bill. We only send bills at the end of the month. Your next bill
will tell you how much you really owe, and if we overcharged you, your
account will be credited. I don't know why the last woman transfered
you here because we don't do what you want. I'll transfer you back to
her. What? Yeah, I can transfer you to the repair departement instead.
</p><p><b>Qwest Rep #4 (male, somewhat helpful):</b> A repairman costs
$85 for the first half-hour and $25 for every extra half-hour. We can
have someone at your house in 20 minutes. You don't have the money
right now? Yeah, I can transfer you to the DSL service people.
</p><p><b>Qwest Rep #5 (foreign female, not helpful):</b> No, we
haven't made any progress on your account in the last week because MSN
still hasn't cancelled your DSL order, and until that's done, we can't
get anything going. Yes, I can transfer you to the MSN department.
</p><p><b>Qwest Rep #6 (female, somewhat helpful):</b> Yes, your order
is marked for cancellation. That takes between 10 and 20 business days.
The only thing I can do to speed that up is put a priority flag on your
request, but there's no guarantee that will help. MSN is sorry to be
losing a customer, but I hope that I was helpful with your customer
service needs. Have a nice day.
</p><p>Final standing: I have one piece of good news (that the
questionable items on my bill were just a billing mistake, and they're
really free), but I can't get a new bill (or even a corrected balance),
I can't afford to get my dead phone jack fixed, and my DSL account may
or may not be delivered on time depending on whether or not MSN gets
around to cancelling my order, which was a Qwest mistake to begin with.

</p><p>I must not have been taking good enough care of myself over the
last few days in Portland, because I was starting to get a little
sniffly before we left. I just blamed it on allergies, though. However,
after the twentieth time that I blew my nose on the train, and the old
man two rows in front of me shot me a dirty look again (he did this
EVERY SINGLE TIME), I was forced to admit that I may have caught a
cold. And sure enough, I woke up the next day with a sore throat.
Luckily, on the way to their house, I got Annie's parents to stop at
the store and allow me to purchase some cold-fighting-materials. Laden
down with Odwalla Vitamin-C-Monster, Orange Juice, Ny-Quil and 7-up, I
triumphantly proceeded to engage my disease in chemical warfare.
Commence saturation bombing with Vitamin C! Drink lots of 7-up! We'll
drown the buggers out! Oh no! The Ny-Quil has caused me to begin a
lengthy and non-sensical war analogy!
</p><p>I spent Thanksgiving day staring blankly into space, and took a
nap. I remember eating dinner, but that was pretty much my only lucid
moment of the day. The next day I felt much better, so I was able to
have some fun with Eric and Jill (and Gavin) when they came to town.
</p><p>Hopefully the two weeks I have until my DSL line is installed,
during which I have to bike or walk to my parents' house every day will
not prolong my cold.
</p><p>Oh, and final note before I'm off to more Ny-Quil induced
sleep: Harry Potter was disappointing. Maybe it was because I had just
read the books, but it seems to me that if the movie is 2.5 hours long,
they could have done a better job. It seriously felt like they just
went through the book and pulled out every other page. I think that as
a visual accompanyment to the book, it's fantastic... but it doesn't
stand on it's own.
