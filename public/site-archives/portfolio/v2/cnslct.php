<p>When I was working for Portland State University's tech team, known internally as CNS-LCT, I was asked to redesign the team's website. The goals were to keep the site simple to use, maintain existing URLs, and keep it visually tied into the school's design style.</p>

<p>This site is no longer available online, as the school has reorganized and redesigned. However, the logo I designed is still in use.</p>
