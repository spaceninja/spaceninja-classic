- **Eat Breakfast Every Day** - I rarely eat breakfast, because I never have an appetite in the morning, but I've found that affects my mood (I get cranky around lunchtime), and also I found out that eating breakfast is supposed to "wake up" your metabolism. By not eating until lunchtime, my body stays in "lazy mode" longer, encouraging my gut to grow ever larger.
- **Go For A Walk Every Morning** - I actually started this one last year, but I fell out of the habit with the bad weather. I need to get back into it. Physical activity, even as light as a quick walk, also helps wake your metabolism up, and it also provides a more clear start to my day than just walking into the next room and turning on the computer.
- **Exercise Every Weekday** - Another goal from last year, which I did pretty well at, and just need to get back in the habit. We have the exercise machine in the living room to make it easier to use, even if it's just for a half hour on my lunch break.
- **Do More Design** - I've spent the last year or so being really focussed on technical tools like PHP and CSS, and I think I'm losing my touch at real design. I need to approach design in terms of visual concepts, rather than CSS techniques.
- **Learn More About Unix** - I have a FreeBSD server in my office, I work on a FreeBSD server every day at work, and my mac laptop is built on top of FreeBSD. I have purchased some books already, and I want to learn more about how to effectively use Unix to work more efficiently in this operating system I interact with on a daily basis.
