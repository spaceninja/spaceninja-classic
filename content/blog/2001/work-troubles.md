HOORJ. I am frustrated. I got in trouble at work today. Not bad trouble, but my boss has warned me twice (once kinda sneakily) that I'm spending too much time on the Net at work, and today he announced that he's disconnecting my computer from the network. I've got no grounds to argue with him, since that computer doesn't have to be on the network, but it's a crummy thing to do, especially since the last time he mentioned that he thought I was on the net too much was like three months ago. I wish he would have given me more warning that he was that close to doing something like this. I dunno, I mean I understand where he's coming from with not wanting to pay for me to goof off, but the way I feel is that if I do my job well, get all my work done in a timely fashion (which I do) then I should be allowed a little slack. He feels differently. Yet another reason I wanna get out of this shit town and back to a place where more people share my opinions.

In addition to that, Urn and I did a really bad show last night, and the station manager told us so. He's right, but when you did the best you could and still failed it kinda sucks to have someone critisize it. We were trying something new, and it bombed, unfortunately. Oh well... we're gonna try twice as hard for the next show and hopefully have better results.

Agggh. On the one hand, I hate getting criticism, because it makes me feel bad, and on the other hand, I hate when people don't tell me, like my boss. You know, I wanna know if someone has a problem with me so I can work on it, but at the same time, I hate when people have a problem with me, because then I feel like shit.

Ooog. Enough ranting.
