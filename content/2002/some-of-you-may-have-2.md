Some of you may have followed the link to [Zach's Comic Chat](http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~chaz/chat/) when he posted it a few days ago. If you're using Internet Explorer on a PC, you will have discovered that the system didn't quite work yet.  
  
Well, he managed to get it fixed, so it's now usable on PC IE. If you haven't given it a try yet, you should do so now!
