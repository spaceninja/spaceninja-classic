Annie and KT and I just got back last night from a great weekend up in Tacoma area. Dave and Rose threw a big fondue party, and invited us, Urn and Kat, Daniel, and a lot of Dave's friends from school. We crashed on their floor that night, and then went to bruch at the Stockfolks', which was excellent.

Highlights of the weekend:
\- Somehow turning "adding you to my phonebook" into innuendo.
\- Much groping, flirting and general boob discussion among KT, Kat, Rose and Annie.
\- Rose informing me that Annie has the best hips of the group.
\- KT stealing the champaign bottle from Rose and draining it while she wasn't looking.
\- Finding out that when one of the characters from DoA beats another one, they make a funny spanking motion.
\- Chocolate fondue
