Dude, I Rule.
...just thought y'all should know that.

Tonight I put the finishing touches on reproducing my default "[rustbucket](/blog/2001/rustbucket/)" layout for Rusted using only CSS, and it's turned out \*flawlessly\*, not to mention being better-written code, standards-complaint, and more bandwidth-efficient. Plus, doing it taught me a couple things that will enable to me get rid of the tables on the design from [www.KM.org](http://www.killingmachines.org/)! I will be posting the finalized versions of these designs soon.
