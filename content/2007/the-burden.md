> "I get the feeling that he’s going to give me one of those very stern lectures about something I have not yet learned about life because I am an entire decade younger than he is. He’s using that tone of voice, like he’s totally exasperated about having to live with the burden of so much wisdom." \-- [Dooce, talking about her husband Jon](http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/06_12_2007.html)
