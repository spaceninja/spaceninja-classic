We went by Goodwill today to get rid of a carload worth of stuff, and while we were there, Zach found these gems in the record rack.

First off, he found an kid's album called "Be A Train." Conveniently, the back of the record jacket provides instructions. There is a cut-out cardboard train for you to make. Once you assemble it, you are told to "put train on head like a hat..." Notice they say _like_ a hat. LEGAL DISCLAIMER: Train is not a hat, and should not be used for hat purposes. Be A Train, Inc. is not responsible for train-hat related injuries! The final bit of text, in bold, informs you that "**now you're a train!**" Congratulations, son! Your father bought you the most disappointing toy ever!

The second album he found is titled simply "**MUSIC TO WATCH GIRLS BY**." So as not to confuse their potential audience, the photo on the cover of the album features a group of men we assume to be the band, identified as "The GIRLWATCHERS." True to both their name and the name of what we can only pray is their only album, they're watching a girl. Who's YOUR favorite Girlwatcher? My favorite is the charming fellow on the right, who is so taken by this girl that he's leaning on his fellow man for support. For the moment, he's completely forgotten about his pipe, and we can only imagine the thoughts running through his mind about the girl with the lollypop.
