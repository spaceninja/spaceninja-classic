JESUS!! is anyone else getting hit as hard as i am by this latest virus??? i'm getting THOUSANDS of virus-emails a day now. it takes 15 minutes to pull down and filter my email in the morning, and if i shut down my client at all, i'll have hundreds more waiting for me.

ridiculous! if i have done one thing for the world, it's been to transition people off the micorsoft tools and onto something a little less error-prone. this is infuriating. it's making email useless to me.
