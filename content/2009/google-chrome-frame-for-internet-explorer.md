Long story short, Google released a plugin for IE 6, 7 and 8 that will run Google Chrome (which uses webkit) inside a frame in the IE browser. Now IE6 can be standards-compliant, and all versions of IE get blazing fast javascript and HTML 5 support. Sounds great, but there are some problems, as [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5365253/google-chrome-frame-turns-internet-explorer-into-a-frankenchrome-browser) points out:

> “The (most) obvious question: Why would I install this plug-in rather than switch browsers to Chrome? The folks at Google point to IT lockdown that won't allow users to install a new browser; Ars wonders whether such restrictive IT departments would be any more likely to approve this plug-in. If nothing else, it's a pretty bold move on the part of Google.”

If you’re interested, [Jim Ray](http://jimray.tumblr.com/post/194793633/more-technical-details-about-google-chrome-frame) dug into the details of how it works. Personally, I don't think this will solve anyone's IE6 problems, but it's a fascinating development, and worth keeping an eye on.

> “The irony here, as I see it, is that an old, insecure feature Microsoft built to try to beat Netscape is now being used by Microsoft’s biggest current rival to patch IE.”
