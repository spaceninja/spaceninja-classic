Noah's housemate Juno has a beautiful 60-inch hi-def plasma TV, and for the past two years, we've gone to watch the Superbowl on it. They always put on a good party, with lots of food and drinks and tons of people. But the best part (for someone who's not a football fanatic, like myself) was hooking the xbox up to it afterwards for a little 8-player halo2 action. It was sweet.
