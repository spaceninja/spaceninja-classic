I've been having a variety of problems with mod_rewrite lately. It boils down to this: [TextDrive](http://www.textdrive.com/) allows me to create subdomains by just making a folder, using some heavy-duty mod_rewrite magic. In addition, [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) lets me get my nice clean permalinks by using mod_rewrite. This works fine for my blog, in a folder off the main domain. But it's causing hell for all the blogs I host on subdomains.

So, after spending the last few days beating my head against this stuff and coming up with nothing, I've finally decided that enough is enough. If I'm hosting your blog on a subdomain, then you don't get the pretty permalinks. If this is a dealbreaker for you, then contact me directly, and we can talk about getting you some hosting of your own. ;)

Now, if none of what I just wrote meant anything to you, then don't worry about it and just ignore this post entirely. Count yourself lucky that you're not having to think about this nonsense as much as I am.

With mod_rewrite out of the way, I'm prepared to move on to slightly more fun challenges such as investigating image posting via WordPress and how to integrate a photo gallery with the blog. After that, I get to redesign [NewsBeat.org](http://www.newsbeat.org/), work with Sean on his blogs, and then (finally) get to my new design for this blog.
