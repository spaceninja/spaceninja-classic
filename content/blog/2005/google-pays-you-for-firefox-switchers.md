Got an AdSense account? Then you might want to take advantage of [Google's new plan to pay you $1 every time someone downloads Firefox from a link on your site](http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=173601284). This could be pretty cool, and might help push Firefox past the early-adopter slump it's experiencing. For more information, check out [Explorer Destroyer](http://explorerdestroyer.com/) and [Kill Bill's Browser](http://www.killbillsbrowser.com/).
