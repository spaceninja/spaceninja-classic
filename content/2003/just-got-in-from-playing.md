just got in from playing a show..first one we've played in a while. it was a lot of fun! made a little cash, got a boatload of free drinks, a plate of fish-and-chips.. and the accordion was a huge hit! hee hee, i must confess.. i really have found my instrument. i don't think i could go back to the fiddle now.  
  
'sides, the ladies _**love**_ the squeezebox. this becomes more clear every time i play ;)  
  
  
anyways, we're playing at the moon and sixpence on 42nd, a block north of sandy, every sunday from 8 till whenever o'clock for the next three weeks. all are invited to come and check it out!
