> "To create a new standard takes something that's not just a little bit different. It takes something that's really new, and captures people's imaginations. Macintosh meets that standard." \-- Bill Gates, Chairman of the Board & CEO, Microsoft Corp. (from a 1984 brochure for the first Macintosh Computer, via [Ganns.com](http://ganns.com/Humor/GatesApple1984/))
