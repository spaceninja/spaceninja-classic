I've had the news on since 7am yesterday. I only got four hours of sleep the night before last, so after [giving blood](http://www.redcross.org/) yesterday, I slept for 10 hours last night and still woke up tired. I can't find the words, or even the right emotions. Like so many people have said, I feel numb and shocked. It's hard to tell yourself that the same imagery we've seen so many times in video games and movies, is for real this time.
