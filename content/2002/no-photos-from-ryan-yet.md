No photos from Ryan yet, but I thought I'd put up one more post real fast before Annie and I head to her parents' house for Dave's graduation party.  
  
I'm pretty sure all the computers are up and functional again. I've now got a super-stable, but kind of slow Win2K box that will be my backup. If this kind of thing ever happens to me again, I won't have to lose any time at work because of it. My computer is all repaired, reinstalled XP and all my programs. I lost all my mp3s, but everything else was backed up, including emails and graphics files, so that's a relief. Annie's computer is running again, though I haven't finished putting all her programs back on, so it's too early to tell if the fact that I reformatted it and took it back down to Windows 2000 improved her stability at all.  
  
Anyways, that's boring you to death, so I'll just cut to the reason why I wanted to post. At it's worst, Annie's computer was crashing every few seconds, whenever a program was launched. Well, one of the new WindowsXP features is to take you to Online Crash Analysis. However, when it launched the browser window to take me there, Annie's computer crashed again, so I managed to take [this lovely screenshot](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/blog-photos/crashcrash.png) before I rebooted. Enjoy.
