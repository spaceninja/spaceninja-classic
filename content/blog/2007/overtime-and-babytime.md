Sorry for all the reviews lately. I've been meaning to get them posted for awhile now, and this week I'm pushing a big deadline at work, so I don't have much motivation to write anything more substantial. On the plus side, when I came home from work tonight, Zoe did something she's never done for me before - She tracked me as I walked across the room and then smiled and laughed a little when I sat down in front of her. It was a lot of fun, and it's got me really excited for the next few months as she learns to interact with us a lot more.
