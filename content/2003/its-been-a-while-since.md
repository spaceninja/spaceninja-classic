it's been a while since any piece of music has really moved me. y'know, i've never really been moved by a choral piece at all, either. till now. when this song that had lay hidden away my enormous playlist popped up. from what seems like a lifetime ago.  
  
(well, that and finding this odd record album of the swingle singers performing bach. hee hee...???)  
  
  
i've decided to take a few singing lessons, too, actually..kinda nice counting a professional singer among my friends!
