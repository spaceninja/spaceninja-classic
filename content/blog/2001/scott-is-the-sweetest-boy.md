he came with me this morning without dragging his heels to get important news at the doctor even though I asked him at the last minute, and then after i went to work to figure out what to do with the rest of the year he ran out and bought me flowers! and cleaned up the house! I walked in and saw a big pink and yellow daisy in a vase by our landing window, and then I turned and went up the stairs and at the top of the stairs was another vase with a red rose in it and I giggled and went into the dining room where there was ANOTHER! vase with red white and purple carnations in it. he was smiling in the corner. :) he's awesome. it was a total romantic girly movie moment and I love him. he did good. :)

So the reason I needed all these flowers was because the doctor told me today what I've been fearing for two weeks... I can't go back to my job. I have three options and I need to sort them all out this weekend and let people know on tuesday what I decide... for right now though it's all about pizza and beer and not thinking about it for an evening. ha.
