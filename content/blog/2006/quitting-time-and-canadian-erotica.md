I love my work, but the tasks I get are frequently of the mind-numbing kind, and if I'm not careful, my brain turns to pudding by late afternoon. To avoid turning into a zombie, I've learned to take a break at about 3:30 every day. I put on my coat, and go walk around the block, and usually give Annie a call. It just takes about 10 minutes, and usually that's all it takes to snap my brain out of the rut.

I used to feel guilty about this, but then I realized that if smokers can take a 10-minute break every few hours, I can get away with getting some air once a day. Usually, everyone is so wrapped up in what they're doing that no one even notices me stepping out, but the office was nearly empty today, and one of my coworkers raised her eyebrow at me when she saw me putting on my coat.

I explained that I was just taking a break, but it made me laugh that she thought I was going home at 3:30. It's like "Well, I'm outta here! \*stretch\* See you tomorrow, suckers!"

This weekend, Annie and I tried to catch up on all the chores that have been neglected over the last few weeks of illness and holidays. We swept and did laundry and everything, and then we sat down to organize all of our filing while we watched TV in our pajamas. We're such a married couple, it's ridiculous.

Of course, the flipside of that coin is that one of the TV shows we recorded is Canadian erotica (It's girly porn called _Bliss_ on the Oxygen channel). So, married life isn't all boring.

I've been trying to help Annie along with her New Year's resolution. I'm going to get her to do a big writeup about it soon, and post it here. It's pretty exciting, because she's basically making big plans for the future, and I love seeing her motivated by her projects. It's tough to get her started on something, but once she gets it into her head that she wants to do something, there's very little that can stop her. It should be awesome to watch this project develop over time.
