Lately I haven't been posting as frequently as I used to, because it doesn't feel like much happens around here. I go to work every day, I hang out with Eric and Jill a lot, and that's about it. I've been rereading MicroSerfs, though, and I'm filled with the desire to post short, humorous stories about things that happen to me and the people I know, but not a lot has been happening.

For anyone who's interested, the earthquake in Olympia did effect us here in Ellensburg. According to my dad, it was measured at 4.8 in Portland, and I think we got about the same here. It was a long (nearly a minute) side-to-side motion, and afterward, they evacuated all the buildings on campus to check for damage.

Speaking of earthquakes, lately, it seems to be a trend among people we know to ask when Annie and I are getting married. I guess when you date someone for nearly three years, and you're not in high school anymore, everyone assumes that's what's next. The funny thing is that it doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I think Annie and I will get married at some point, but it's not like we've made firm plans about it. We do joke about what our wedding will be like, though.

The other day, in fact, as Annie and I were watching Friends, and they were talking about weddings, we started talking about it, and she casually mentioned that maybe she didn't even want a minister at ours.

"We just say our own vows. It's really romantic," she said. Now, I'm fairly open about what she wants at our wedding. My take on the whole thing is that this a mostly for her, so let her do what she wants with it. And while neither one of us is very religious, and we don't want a huge god-fearing ceremony, I do want someone to run the ceremony. As I told Annie, without a minister, it's basically just a party, not a wedding (yes, I know _legally_ we would still be married, but that's not the point).
