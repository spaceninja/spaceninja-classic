Sorry for the long silence. There's been a lot going on away from my keyboard, and I've been going through one of those phases where I'm reluctant to post. This is partly due to being involved in about five web projects at once, and trying to juggle them all is leaving me with little mental space to write here.

Additionally, I'm pretty fed up with my web hosting provider. ReadySetConnect seemed like a great deal when I started, but their only real advantage was the amount of storage space and bandwidth that I got for the price. It's still a good deal, but I no longer need anywhere near the amount of transfer or space I'm paying for.

The other major factor is that RSC has atrocious tech support. They always have, and I've struggled with this from day one. They recently removed all phone numbers from their website and are doing tech support exclusively through web forms. This would be fine if they ever actually answered their support tickets, but I've yet to get any replies.

I'm hesitant to rock the boat by jumping to a new provider, but the last straw came this morning when I found out that they turned off my shell access with no notification or explanation provided. Appearently, I can send a support ticket to get access back, but this is just dumb. Assuming they actually answer the ticket, I'm still irritated that I have to ask them to re-enable a service I already had.

Right now the primary contenders for me are [NearlyFreeSpeech.net](http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/), which is no-frills, ugly, and not user-friendly. But they offer everything you need, as long as you don't mind the odd setup they have for administering it. No tech support that I can see, but their main advantage is price. I can get hosted there for just a few dollars a month (it's a sliding scale based on bandwidth and disk space). The other appealing company is [TextDrive.com](http://www.textdrive.com/), who offer the complete package, everything I need, but cost about the same as what I'm paying now, $12/month. I don't mind continuing to pay that if that gets me better support and stability, so I'm talking to Miles now (who just got an account there) to see if they're all they're cracked up to be.

Oh, the other nice feature that TextDrive offers, which is certainly not required, but would be excellent, is IMAP email services. That would be EXCELLENT.

So what this means is that there might be some changes coming to my websites sooner than expected, if I move to a new server.
