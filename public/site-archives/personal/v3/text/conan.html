<font size=4><b>Conan O'Brien's Commencement Speech At Harvard</b></font>

<p>I'd like to thank the Class Marshals for inviting me here today. The last
time I was invited to Harvard it cost me $110,000, so you'll forgive me if
I'm a bit suspicious. I'd like to announce up front that I have one goal
this afternoon: to be half as funny as tomorrow's Commencement Speaker,
Moral Philosopher and Economist, Amartya Sen.  Must get more laughs than
seminal wage/price theoretician.

<p>Students of the Harvard Class of 2000, fifteen years ago I sat where you
sit now and I thought exactly what you are now thinking: What's going to
happen to me? Will I find my place in the world?  Am I really graduating a
virgin?  I still have 24 hours and my roommate's Mom is hot. I swear she
was checking me out.

<p>Being here today is very special for me. I miss this place. I especially
miss Harvard Square - it's so unique. No where else in the world will you
find a man with a turban wearing a Red Sox jacket and working in a lesbian
bookstore. Hey, I'm just glad my dad's working.

<p>It's particularly sweet for me to be here today because when I graduated, I
wanted very badly to be a Class Day Speaker.  Unfortunately, my speech was
rejected. So, if you'll indulge me, I'd like to read a portion of that
speech from fifteen years ago: "Fellow students, as we sit here today
listening to that classic Ah-ha tune which will definitely stand the test
of  time, I would like to make several predictions about what the future
will hold: "I believe that one day a simple Governor from a small Southern
state will rise to the highest office in the land. He will lack political
skill, but will lead on the sheer strength of his moral authority."    "I
believe that Justice will prevail and, one day, the Berlin Wall will
crumble, uniting East and West Berlin forever under Communist rule."   "I
believe that one day, a high speed network of interconnected computers will
spring up world-wide, so enriching people that they will lose their
interest in idle chit chat and pornography."     "And finally, I believe
that one day I will have a television show on a major network, seen by
millions of people a night, which I will use to  re-enact crimes and help
catch at-large criminals."  And then there's some stuff about the death of
Wall Street which I don't think we need to get into....

<p>I was  actually a student here once much like you. I came here in the fall
of 1981 and lived in Holworthy.  I was, without exaggeration, the ugliest
picture  in the Freshman Face book. When Harvard asked me for a picture the
previous summer, I thought it was just for their records, so I literally
jogged in the August heat to a passport photo office and sat for a morgue
photo.

<p>To make matters worse, when the Face Book came out they put my picture next
to Catherine Oxenberg, a stunning blonde actress who was accepted to the
class of '85 but decided to defer admission so she could join the cast of
"Dynasty." My photo would have looked bad on any page, but next to
Catherine Oxenberg, I looked like a mackerel that had been in a car
accident. You see, in those days I was six feet four inches tall and I
weighed 150   pounds.  Recently, I had some structural engineers run those
numbers into a computer model and, according the computer, I collapsed in
1987, killing hundreds in Taiwan.

<p>After freshman year I moved to Mather House. Mather House,incidentally, was
designed by the same firm that built  Hitler's bunker. In fact, if Hitler
had conducted the war from Mather House, he'd have shot himself a year
earlier.

<p>1985 seems like a long time ago now. When I had my Class Day, you students
would have been seven years old. Seven years old.  Do you know what that
means? Back then I could have beaten any of you in a fight. And I mean bad.
It would be no contest. If any one here has a time machine, seriously,
let's get it on, I will whip your seven year old butt.  When I was here,
they sold diapers at the Coop that said "Harvard Class of 2000." At the
time, it was kind of a joke, but now I realize you wore those diapers. How
embarrassing for you.  A lot has happened in fifteen years. When you think
about it, we come from completely different worlds.  When I graduated, we
watched movies starring Tom Cruise and listened to music by  Madonna. I
come from a time when we huddled around our TV sets and watched "The Cosby
Show" on NBC, never imagining that there would one day be a show called
"Cosby" on CBS. In 1985 we drove cars with driver's side airbags, but if
you told us that one day there'd be passenger side airbags, we'd have
burned you for witchcraft.   But of course, I think there is some common
ground between us. I remember well the great uncertainty of this day.  Many
of you are justifiably nervous about leaving the safe, comfortable world of
Harvard Yard and hurling yourself headlong into the cold, harsh world of
Harvard Grad School, a plum job at your father's firm, or a year abroad
with a gold Amex card and then a plum job in your father's firm.  But let
me assure you that the knowledge you've gained here at Harvard is a
precious gift that will never leave you. Take if from me, your education is
yours to keep forever. Why, many of you have read the Merchant of Florence,
and that will inspire you when you travel to the island of Spain. Your
knowledge of that problem they had with those people in Russia, or that guy
in South America-you know, that guy-will enrich you for the rest of your
life.  There is also sadness today, a feeling of loss that you're leaving
Harvard forever. Well, let me assure you that you never really leave
Harvard. The Harvard Fundraising Committee will be on your ass until the
day you die.  Right now, a member of the Alumni Association is at the Mt.
Auburn Cemetery shaking down the corpse of Henry Adams.  They heard he had
a brass toe ring and they aims to get it. Imagine:  These people just
raised 2.5 billion dollars and they only got through the B's in the alumni
directory. Here's how it works. Your phone rings, usually after a big meal
when you're tired and most vulnerable. A voice asks you for money. Knowing
they just raised 2.5 billion dollars you ask, "What do you need it for?"
Then there's a long pause and the voice on the other end of the Line says,
"We don't need it, we just want it." It's chilling.  What else can you
expect? Let me see, by your applause, who here wrote a thesis.

<p>(APPLAUSE)

<p>A lot of hard work, a lot of your Blood went into that thesis... and no one
is ever going to care. I wrote a thesis: Literary Progeria in the works of
Flannery O'Connor and William Faulkner. Let's just say that, during my
discussions with Pauly Shore, it doesn't come up much. For three years
after graduation I kept my thesis in the glove compartment of my car so I
could show it to a policeman in case I was pulled over. (ACT OUT) License,
registration,cultural exploration of the Man Child in the Sound and the
Fury...  So what can you expect out there in the real world?  Let me tell
you.  As you leave these gates and re-enter society, one thing is certain:

<p>Everyone out there is going to hate you. Never tell anyone in a roadside
diner that you went to Harvard. In most situations the correct response to
where did you to school is, "School? Why, I never had much in the way of
book larnin' and such." Then, get in your BMW and get the hell out of
there. You see, you're in for a lifetime of "And you went to Harvard?"
Accidentally give the wrong amount of change in a transaction and it's "And
you went to Harvard?" Ask the guy at the hardware store how these jumper
cables work and hear, "And you went to Harvard?"  Forget just once that
your underwear goes inside your pants and it's "and you went to Harvard."
Get your head stuck in your niece's dollhouse because you wanted to see
what it was like to be a giant and it's "Uncle Conan, you went to
Harvard!?" But to really know what's in store for you after Harvard, I have
to tell you what happened to me after graduation. I'm going to tell you my
story because, first of all, my perspective may give many of you hope, and,
secondly, it's an amazing rush to stand in front of six thousand people and
talk about yourself.

<p>After graduating in May, I moved to Los  Angeles and got a three week
contract at a small cable show. I got a $380 a month apartment and bought a
1977 Isuzu Opel, a car Isuzu only manufactured for a year because they
found out that, technically, it's not a car. Here's a quick tip, graduates:
no four cylinder vehicle should have a racing stripe. I worked at that show
for over a year, feeling pretty good about myself, when one day they told
me they were letting me go.

<p>I was fired and, Ihadn't saved a lot of money. I tried to get another Job
in television but I couldn't find one. So, with nowhere else to turn, I
Went to a temp agency and filled out a questionnaire. I made damn sure they
knew I had been to Harvard and that I expected the very best treatment.
And so, the next day, I was sent to the Santa Monica branch of Wilson's
House of Suede and Leather. When you have a Harvard degree and you're
working at Wilson's House of Suede and Leather, you are Haunted by the
ghostly images  of your classmates who chose Graduate School.  You see
their faces everywhere: in coffee cups, in fish tanks, and they're always
laughing at you  as you stack suede shirts no man, in good conscience,
would ever wear. I tried a lot of things during this period:  acting in
corporate infomercials, serving drinks in a non-equity theatre, I even took
a job entertaining at a seven year olds' birthday party.  In desperate need
of work, I  put together some sketches and scored a job at the fledgling
Fox Network  as a writer and performer for a new show called "The Wilton
North Report." I was finally on a network and really excited. The producer
told me the show was going to revolutionize television. And, in a way, it
did.  The show was so hated and did so badly that when, four weeks later,
news  of its cancellation was announced to the Fox affiliates, they burst
into applause. Eventually, though, I got a huge break. I had submitted,
along with my writing partner, a Batch of sketches to  Saturday Night Live
and, after a year and a half, they read it and gave us a  two week tryout.
The two weeks turned into two seasons and I felt successful. Successful
enough to write a TV pilot for an original sitcom and, when  the network
decided to make it, I left Saturday Night Live. This TV show  was going to
be groundbreaking.  It was going to resurrect the career of TV's Batman,
Adam West. It was going to be a comedy without a  laugh track or a studio
audience. It was going to change all the  rules. And here's what happened:
When the pilot aired it was the second lowest-rated television show of all
time. It's tied with a test pattern they show in Nova Scotia.  So, I was 28
and, once again, I had no job. I  had good writing credits in New York, but
I was filled with disappointment and didn't know what to do next. I started
smelling suede on my fingertips. And that's when The Simpsons saved me. I
got a job there and started writing episodes about Springfield getting a
Monorail and Homer going  to College. I was finally putting my Harvard
education to good use, writing dialogue for a man who's so stupid that in
one episode he forgot to make his own heart beat. Life was good. And then,
an insane, inexplicable opportunity  came my way . A chance to audition for
host of the new Late Night Show.  I took the opportunity seriously but, at
the same time, I had the relaxed confidence of someone who knew he had no
real shot.  I couldn't fear losing a great job I had never had. And, I
think that attitude made the difference.  I'll never forget being in
the Simpson's recording basement that morning when the phone rang.  It was
for me. My car was blocking a fire lane.

<p>But a week later I got another call: I got the job.  So, this was
undeniably the it: the truly life-altering break I had always dreamed of.
And, I went to work. I gathered all my funny friends and poured all my
years of comedy experience into building that show over the summer,
gathering the talent and figuring out the sensibility. We debuted on
September 13, 1993 and I was happy with our effort. I felt like I had
seized the moment and put my very best foot forward.

<p>And this is what the most respected and widely read television critic, Tom
Shales, wrote in the Washington Post: "O'Brien is a living collage of
annoying  nervous habits. He giggles and titters, jiggles about and fiddles
with his  cuffs. He had dark, beady little eyes like a rabbit. He's one of
the  whitest  white men ever. O'Brien is a switch on the guest who won't
leave: he's  the host who should never have come.  Let the Late show with
Conan  O'Brien become the late, Late Show and may the host return to Conan
O'Blivion   whence he came." There's more but it gets kind of mean.
Needless to say, I took a lot of criticism, some of it deserved, some of it
excessive. And it hurt like you wouldn't believe. But I'm telling you all
this for a reason. I've had a lot of success and I've had a lot of failure.
I've looked good and I've looked bad. I've been praised and I've been
criticized. But my mistakes have been necessary. Except for Wilson's House
of Suede and Leather. That was just stupid.

<p>I've dwelled on my failures today because, as graduates of Harvard, your
biggest liability is your need to succeed.  Your need to always find
yourself on the sweet side of the bell curve.  Because success is a lot
like a bright, white tuxedo. You feel terrific when you get it, but then
you're desperately afraid of getting it dirty, of spoiling it in any way. I
left the cocoon of Harvard, I left the cocoon of Saturday Night Live, I
left the cocoon of The Simpsons. And each time it was bruising and
tumultuous. And yet, every failure was freeing, and today I'm as nostalgic
for the bad as I am for the good. So, that's what I wish for all of you:
the bad   as well as the good. Fall down, make a mess, break something
occasionally. And remember that the story is never over.  If it's all
right, I'd  like to read a little something from just this year: "Somehow,
Conan O'Brien has transformed himself into the brightest star in the Late
Night firmament. His comedy is the  gold standard and Conan himself is not
only the quickest and most inventive wit of his generation, but quite
possible the greatest host ever."

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Class of 2000, I wrote  that this morning, as proof
that, when all else fails, there's always delusion.  I'll go now, to make
bigger mistakes and to embarrass this fine institution even more. But let
me leave you  with one last thought:

<p>If you can laugh at yourself loud and hard every time you fall, people will
think you're drunk.

<p>Thank you.
