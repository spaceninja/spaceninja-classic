Over the holidays, Zoe spent a lot of time with her cousins. Since she's an only child and the only girl in the group, it's pretty interesting to watch how differently she reacts to situations. In general, she's delighted to see the boys' high energy and rough-housing, and she likes to join in. Unfortunately, she hasn't had to get as tough as Milo or Theo, and inevitably, it ends in tears. But once she gets calmed down, she never hesitates to dive back into the fray.

This particular photo was taken on a day when just Milo and Zoe were hanging out. It's interesting how the dynamic shifts when it's just the two of them. They're the same age, and they tend to play at about the same speed. They had these crayons designed for kids to color on the windows, and they were happily scribbling away for about 20 minutes together.
