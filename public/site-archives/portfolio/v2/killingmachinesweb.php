<p>The KillingMachines.org weblog community needed a redesign of their portal page, which was outdated and clumsy. The new design features subtle use of colors, and faint images of machinery in the background of the page. This design was built using DHTML, CSS, and some PHP to include the header and footer code on each page.</p>

<p>Due to a major server crash, the community has since closed, and the site is no longer available online.</p>
