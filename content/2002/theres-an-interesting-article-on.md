There's an interesting article on [space.com](http://www.space.com/) called ["Sex and Society Aboard the First Starships"](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/star_voyage_020319-1.html). Personally, I can't get enough of this kind of stuff. I love reading about the way space travel will work. And while writing this post, I stumbled onto another article about [the ways that language might change on a interstellar trip](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/generalscience/interstellar_english_020314.html).
