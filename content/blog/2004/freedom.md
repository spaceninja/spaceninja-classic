yay! now I have time to make biscuits!!!! and by biscuits...I mean babies....

I AM SO DONE WITH SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!

Everything has been crossed off the white board to do list with plenty of veg. time to spare....

Scott, I love you, you have been so patient and supportive of me while I've just trampled all over everything in my attempt to graduate so we can move on with our lives....you deserve a freakin' medal or something for all you've put up with.

or will a baby do? ;)
