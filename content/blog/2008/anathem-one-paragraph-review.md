I started reading Anathem with some hesitation, because I really didn't get into The Baroque Cycle. It's not that they were bad books, I just wasn't into the time period they were set in. Thankfully, this is a return to his earlier style of spec-fic, and I found the world he invented absolutely compelling. The book is presented as a journal kept by the main character, and is basically divided into two parts. The first half introduces us to the world he lives in â€” a sort of inversion of our world, where scientists isolate themselves in monastic communities called Maths. These communities are built around [Millenium Clocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_of_the_Long_Now), which only open the gates to the outside world at predefined intervals (1 year, 10 years, 100 years, and 1000 years, depending on the Math). Our story starts as a ten-year Math prepares for their gate to open. The second half of the book is the action story, describing a series of world-changing events. I can't describe any further without ruining some surprises, but suffice to say that it's a great story.
