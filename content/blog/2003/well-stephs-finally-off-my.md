well, steph's finally off my server. in a few days, all the server logs for this month will be rotated out, such that when march 1st arrives, the only trace of her life on fojar will be in the log archives. she didn't even have the courtesy to tell me she'd finalized her transfer. i guess she had to get in some final insult.

— IN OTHER NEWS ... —

my band gaida (we're soon changing our name - these one-word hard-to-spell unpronounceable foreign things are awful) is playing at a **_huge_** show on friday! the promoters are now complaining that far too many people are coming for the size of concert hall we're in (and it's not that small!) this show's been getting a lot of radio-advertising, and it's been in all the local papers.

so, i'd invite you all to come but i don't know if you'll be able to fit in the door :)

anyways, here are the facts: it's a benefit for peace at (i think, i'll have to double-check tonight) st andrews cathedral on NE 8th and alberta. there are a bunch of big-name folk bands from all countries of origin, and somehow we got in too. there's a suggested $5 donation.

it's very exciting, my second "professional musician" gig and already playing to packed halls. if i were anyone else, i might be nervous.. but nah, this is exciting stuff!

— oh! check out these great old photos i found last night: http://www.fojar.com/~steve/pics/interesting_older_stuff/

and that's not the best news of late.. \*grinning\*

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Sadly, we no longer control the fojar domain name, so the link to Steve's photos doesn't work anymore.
