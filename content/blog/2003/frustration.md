\*sigh\* Nothing like getting all done burning five copies of the CD containing the artwork for the crunchpod CD, and printing out 6 copies of every file for various people along the stage of the printing process, only to notice a tiny typo on one page, so you have to correct two files and burn all the CDs and reprint the copies of that page again.

Still... It's all done now. Tomorrow I'll get Steve to swing by the post office on our way to get sushi and then I can start breathing again.
