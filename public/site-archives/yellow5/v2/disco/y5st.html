<big>Yellow Number Five - Arrakis Records</big>

<P>This self-titled album, released in 2000 on Arrakis Records, was the first full-length compilation released by the newly-reformed group Yellow Number Five. Following their much-publicized court case in which Dr. Colossus, recently returned from what was widely believed to be his own death, sued his former band mates for possession of the band's name. Following the win, Colossus restructured the band and hired the famous Norwegian remix artists J&ouml;rg Besson and Franka Kurtz to join him in making Y5 the most well known of the growing community of remix bands. The electronica revisitation of "Folsom Prison Blues," an early hit by Johnny Cash, won immediate fame and a great deal of airplay.
