:: HATELIFE IS NIGHTMARES ::

ugh... I'm not sleeping so well lately. Going to bed too late, getting up too late, eating before I go to bed... I'm sure they're all contributing to this charming series of nightmares I've been having. The other night I woke up and my entire body was sore because I was so tense, and the only thing I could remember from the dream was the image of an evil-looking switchblade.

Last night I fell asleep around 3am, and now it's 7:43am... I just woke up again, all tense and not-well-rested. But I remember more details this time.

My character (it wasn't me) returns to his home to find his family slaughtered. The man responsible is some sort of twisted fuck with the power to control people. The killer, someone called "The Professor" was going to be home any minute. My character is talking to the main guy, whose name I don't remember. For some reason, the guy was enjoying explaining to me what was going on. I was a mixture of sick, terrified and devastated, having just had to clean some stuff up (possibly the bodies? really messy, knives again). I was at what is in real life my parent's house, in my old bedroom, having to move some furniture around, grabbing some stuff quickly because I was going to run. This was part of the evil guy's plan. I knew "the professor" would be home any minute, and I was scared to meet him. Then the evil guy was explaining to me that he wanted us to meet. I didn't want to, but I had no choice. I asked if my life was in danger, and the evil guy laughed and said "no... well, yes... maybe." and then laughed some more and vanished. Then he disappeared as I tried to figure out how to handle this. The professor would be here any minute, and when he saw that I had cleaned, he would know that I knew, so I had to meet him and pretend I didn't know he killed them in order to get out alive.

I heard the door downstairs open and I was preparing myself to go out and do this, and I realized it wasn't the killer, it was three other people. Two I don't recognize (maybe I did in the dream?) but one was Annie, my real-life girlfriend. Since my family was dead in the dream, maybe she wasn't supposed to be my girlfriend in the dream. I got the feeling she was someone different, but I still cared about her deeply and was scared that she would get hurt when the killer arrived.

That's when I woke up, feeling ill. What the hell is going on? Why am I having nightmares?
