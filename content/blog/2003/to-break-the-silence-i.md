to break the silence, i will make a post about my day yesterday. i awoke from a bizarre dream much too early in the morning for my comfort, so that i would be awake when the cable guy came to enable my cable modem service. which is now enabled, so i finally get to cancel my home phone line and end qwest's stranglehold over my pocketbook hooray!

\[aside: in the new forum software i'm working on, there will be a clever mechanism to type out a detailed report of the dreams that meshes well with the narrative here, but does not rely on CSS tricks or altering this page's flow.\]

all day long i worked hard, both on software and on the fiddle, until the end when i was struck by an extraordinarily and unusually clever idea about how to solve some sticky problems in our software rewrite, which i then mailed to miles and am awaiting his feedback on.

then i had another vivid and bizarre dream last night, which again i would describe in detail if the software would accomodate the kind of presentation i desire. but since it doesn't, i must keep these gems of the subconscious to myself.. and yes, some of you were there! tee hee

today, too, has started off well.. i learned a tarantella on the fiddle, and collected a recording of a nice little irish tune to add to my repertoir, too. \[tangent: [the amazing slow-downer](http://www.ronimusic.com/) is my new best friend for learning music.\]
