<BR>Here we go... four weeks of school left. I'm really glad I'm only taking 14 credits this term, I think it's really helping to keep my stress levels down. Things are proceeding at landslide speed, but I feel like I'm riding that landslide instead of falling down with it uncontrollably. It's sort of an interesting feeling. I have a ton going on, but I feel like I've just barely got it all under control.

<P>The situation at home is getting tense. Our neighbors are become more and more obnoxious. One of them used my towel the other day, which is kinda gross. They continue to use our dishes and then not clean them, they never clean up after themselves, so the kitchen and bathroom are trashed, and they haven't refilled the toilet paper in a month (I wouldn't know this, except that in response to that, we started keeping a roll in our room, and waiting for them to fill it). We're still waiting. But, they move out on the first of June (what a birthday present!), so I don't have long to wait. I'll be moving out pretty soon after that, so I don't get to enjoy the new neighbors long, but it'll still be nice to see them go.

<P>I can't wait for summer so I can start working on all the great ideas I have running through my head. I'm excited about all of them, but I can't really devote any time to them until school's out.

<P>Hmmm... I don't really have anything to add right now. I'll write again another time.

<P>(follow-up note: Mom's tests came back negative. All is well in the kingdom of Scott).
