Yesterday my xbox 360 died. Kinda funny that it happened just a day after Microsoft announces that they're extending the warranties, but it doesn't really apply to me, since they only extended the warranty for one specific error (three red lights), which mine doesn't have, and it's a moot point anyways, since my 360 is still under warranty.

The problem I'm having is that my video suddenly quit working, leaving me with just a black screen with scrolling white dots, as described in [this forum](http://forums.xbox.com/13392007/ShowPost.aspx). After reading through the forum, I was a bit discouraged, because there's no fix available. Lots of people are having this problem, and you just have to send your box in for repair - and since the warranty got extended, they changed the average wait for repair from 5 days to 25 days, which means I might have to wait a month to get it back.

This morning I called tech support, and after going through 2 different phone trees, both of which tried to get me to hang up if I was just calling for a rebate, I finally got through to a real person who, surprisingly, was helpful! I told her I had already tried all the suggestions in the support FAQ, like unplugging everything and plugging it back it, trying with a different set of cables (lucky I have two) and booting without the hard drive. After just a few minutes verifying that I had tried all that, she got me a repair number, and said they were sending me a box to ship my xbox back in. Since I'm still under warranty, the repair and the shipping will be free. The box should be here via UPS in 3-4 business days, and then once they get it, it'll be 10-20 days for the repair.

So, it sucks that it might take a full month to get it back, but on the other hand, this is the best possible time for it to happen. I'm not actually playing anything on my 360 right now, but starting in August, there's several games coming out that I'll be playing, so at least it sounds like I'll have it back and fully functional before then.
