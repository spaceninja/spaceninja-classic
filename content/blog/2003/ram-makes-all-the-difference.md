Compare and Contrast:

- [iBook with 128 MB of RAM](/images/blog-photos/ibook128.jpg)
- [iBook with 640 MB of RAM](/images/blog-photos/ibook640.jpg)

Needless to say, everything is running smooth and deadly now. I already liked my iBook when it was running slowly and chugging through basic things like loading webpages, but now I'm loving it!
