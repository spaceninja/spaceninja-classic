Things are coming along. All the blogs are converted to WordPress and my switch to my new webhost, [TextDrive.com](http://www.textdrive.com/) is done. I'm taking this week to educate myself about WordPress and learn how to do some of the things I knew how to do with Movable Type. Some things are suprisingly easy to do (such as "edit" links for each post, which happens automatically and only displays to the author, when they're logged in). Other things are suprisingly difficult to do (can I really not get a list of "recently commented" posts or an offset lists of posts without using a plugin?).

TextDrive is interesting. As a host, they seem rock solid, fast, and reliable. I was able to get shell access easily, and they even changed my shell to tcsh, with full access, something my old host wouldn't do. Some things are kind of odd, though. For instance, the admin interface for web administration is terrible. They use WebMin, which is really just intended to be a GUI for Unix power-users, which doesn't really include me. I can do everything, but I don't know how to do any of it. Luckily, it turns out my needs are minimal. Another odd things is that the simple way they set up to do subdomains conflicts with the .htaccess mod\_rewrite rules that WordPress relies heavily on. Lucky for me, one of the support guys was well-versed in this, and helped me find a solution. I've had to talk to support three times, and I've gotten speedy responses all three times. So far, I'm quite happy with them, and I'd recommend them.
