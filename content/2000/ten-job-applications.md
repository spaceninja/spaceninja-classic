Oog. It's been quite a day. I got up this morning, and filled out applications for TEN different places. They were charming work locations such as Jack-In-The-Box, Ellensburg Bowling, Mr. G's Mini-Mart, TWO separate 7-11s and a couple gas stations. Have you ever filled out TEN applications in a row? It sucks. It's a lot of boring, time-consuming work. So I killed time by playing a bad sci-fi movie in the background. It was some horrible thing on the sci-fi channel about an outpost on a far planet who's discovered alien life and is all angsty about the implications for philosophy and religion.

Then, after Annie and I had some soup (crucial detail there... no way I could have left that out... you would have been like "But WHAT did you have for LUNCH, scott?"), we walked all over this stupid town and turned in every single one of them. And every single one of them told me the same thing. "We're not hiring right now, but it can't hurt to keep it on file!"

Jack-In-The-Box said they might be hiring someone for some odd hours and that the manager might call me. I'm not holding my breath, but I'll call back tomorrow to make sure they know I'm interested. Also, the Thunderbird Motel has decided it's hiring again (this is one of the many places that already turned me down in the last two months). So Annie and I filled out new applications, and the guy said the owners would contact us within a week, hopefully. They're in Korea right now, so I can't harass anyone yet, but once they're back, I'll call.

Why the rush? Meadowlark turned me down. She decided that while she's still interested, she can't afford a web page right now, especially since some competition just opened in town. So there goes the $500 of rent we had paid. She's a really nice lady and I'm not mad at her at all, but it's very frustrating.

However, the crisis was averted when we returned home this evening, to beg our parents for money. We were sort of expecting to bum about half off each of our families, but Annie's parents agreed to GIVE us the full $800. Not a loan. Awesome. And that leaves the Vandehey Family Bank (just kidding, Mom and Dad) untapped, in case of emergency next month, which we hopefully won't need.

In other good news, Jill asked me to participate in a weekly news radio interview segment... sort of a human interest feature. This week I'm going to be interviewing her dad, who was a fighter pilot in WWII! How cool! I bet he has some great stories.
