The noble Yayoi, self-named after a period of ancient Japanese history, who moved into the house with a "guest" who is actually her son (adoptive) as of one year ago. She comes from an indigenous tribe of Taiwan whose traditional dress resembles that of the Thai people. She speaks four languages: Chinese, Japanese, English, and her tribal language. She is teaching me Japanese in exchange for advanced English. Studying French, as well.
