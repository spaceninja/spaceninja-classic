Sorry for the lengthy silence, but things have been a bit crazy around here. We helped my brother move about a month ago, then packed everything we owned, then we moved into a house in the Alberta neighborhood with Sean. The move went relatively smoothly, and we even got everything done in one long day, thanks to the help of all our friends who came out to spend the day hauling boxes around. Since then we've just been trying to unpack and get the house into some sort of order, which finally happened over the weekend.

The first thing we did while moving was lock the kittens into the basement bathroom (one of THREE in the house) along with their litterbox and food and water. We left them there for the next several days, letting them get acclimatized to a small part of the house first.

In the meantime, I pulled together the basement to be the excellent media center I've been assembling for the last couple of years. We've got our surround sound setup all put together, with the speakers suspended from the ceiling, and the subwoofer in the corner, and it's impressively loud when I want it to be. It also works well for watching regular television, as we found out with 24 and Galactica last week.

Once the basement was assembled and pretty much cat-proofed, we let them out of their prison, and they have since taken ownership of the basement from us. Sean has a papa-san chair that's full of pillows and cushions, which they love to sleep in, and the rest of the time, they tear around the open area wrestling with each other.

On the main floor, we've got the living room 99% unpacked, with the bookshelves assembled and filled, which is great, but makes it very obvious that we don't yet have any furniture for the living room. Our next trip to Ikea is going to involve a couple of couches, I'm thinking.

The office is assembled, but packed full of boxes, and I don't yet have an internet connection on my PC, since the cable modem and wifi router is in the basement, and my PC doesn't have a wifi card. I was going to buy an Airport Express from Apple, which (I thought) would let me extend my wifi network, and give me an ethernet connection for any computers near it, and even let me hook it up to the stereo to stream iTunes. However, it turns out that not only will it not talk to my home network for some reason, it also isn't physically capable of hooking an ethernet connection up to a computer. The ethernet jack is only to hook it up to an existing network. So instead, I'm buying the netgear equivalent, which I know for a fact does everything I need, but sadly won't stream iTunes.

Part of my reluctance to post has been the network problems (which is rediculous, since we have two laptops in the house with wifi), but it's hard to motivate myself to sit down at the dining room table or on the couch to post, instead of my nice office. Anyways, the solution is coming, and I'll be back to my usual frequently-posting self.

Oh, and speaking of frequent posting, I have a [work blog at Pop Art](http://scott.staging.popart.com/) now. My boss wants us all to start blogging to share our goals and accomplishments, which is pretty cool. Unfortunately, as a Microsoft house, we don't have any Apache/PHP/MySQL boxes, so I can't run WordPress. Instead, we're running a program called [DasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net/), which he says is the most downloaded blog program on XXX. All I know is that it's a bit of a letdown from WordPress. Still, it does everything it's supposed to (even if the back-end is a big ugly), and it's skinnable, so I'll be able to apply my own design to it soon enough. You're all welcome to read my work blog, obviously, but I'll warn you in advance that it's going to be limited to highly geeky discussions of programming, CSS, and web development (even moreso than here).

Photos and floorplan coming as soon as I get the PC hooked up to the network!
