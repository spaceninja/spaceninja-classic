My apologies to any family members or readers of a more linguistically-sensitive nature, but it was needed. For you see, I have acquired somewhat of a cursed touch with computers recently.

PART THE FIRST: In which I purchase the upgrade to The Sims (which works fine on both Annie's Win98 box and my Win2K box), only to discover that the upgrade doesn't work in Windows 2000.

PART THE SECOND: In which I attempt to upgrade Annie's video card drivers and BIOS, and end up frying the card in the process. Diagnosis still uncertain. Tech support's only suggestion doesn't look promising. How much am I willing to put into a new video card for an old machine?

PART THE THIRD: In which I manage to delete an entire hard drive from my machine while attempting to create a dual-boot with Windows 98. Final Diagnosis: Dual-booting achieved successfully, at the cost of the entire contents of a 14GB hard drive, containing a year's worth of MP3 harvesting (8GB) and ALL of my graphics files (a HUGE deal to a graphic designer). Some of these graphics can be restored from a backup. Some, such as the Myst3 Photoshop files from the job I just did, are unrecoverable.

Sometimes it's better to just leave things as they are, rather than obsessively attempt to update and upgrade them, but hindsight is 20/20.
