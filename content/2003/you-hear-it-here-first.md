happy birthday miles! soon you will be able to drink and buy tobacco and rent car!  
  
  
just a quick note to all my adoring fans, in portland and spying on me from other corners - i'm gonna quit the folk band. as my good friend eddie put it, "if it doesn't feed your soul, and it isn't paying really well, bail while the bailing's good."
