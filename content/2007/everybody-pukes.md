Zoe's second monthly newsletter is late, but I have a good excuse: Everyone is sick. I stayed home from work today to help take care of Zoe so Annie could rest. Last night, Annie threw up on the floor in the basement. While trying to clean it up, I also threw up. Then, while Sean was cleaning up the rest of it, I went to pick up Zoe, who was crying, and discovered that she had spit up. Still, you know what they say about the family that pukes together...

Anyways, while you're waiting for me to finish writing the newsletter, I uploaded a whole bunch of [photos](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/) and [movies](http://www.vimeo.com/user:spaceninja/clips), which you should go check out, including this, which is my new favorite photo of Milo.
