The cold I had at Christmas appears to have hopped from person to person and come all the way back around to get me sick again. I feel miserable, but I know there are a few tasks at work that have to be done today, so I'm waiting to hear from my boss on what he absolutely needs me to do before I can just go sit on the couch and pass out for the rest of the day.
