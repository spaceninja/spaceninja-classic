                <br><b>Scott 2000</b>: I'm just going to take control of the content in this section of the site. My musical taste has matured quite a bit since I was your age.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: You mean you don't listen to <a href="http://www.9inchnails.com/index.html">Nine Inch Nails</a> anymore?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Well, I do, but I mean that I don't listen to as much pop crap. I'm more into ambient techno stuff. You know, the kind of stuff that Colin keeps trying to get you to listen to?

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: But that stuff sucks!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Trust me, you're going to end up liking it. Someday you'll be embarrassed about the fact that you used to like Meat Loaf and Def Leppard.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Whatever, man… Adrenalize is a fresh album. I'm never gonna get tired of that! And I'm already tired of Meat Loaf.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: That's only because you dumped the girl who gave you the CD.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Why don't you like Grunge music? It's starting to get really cool! I heard this song by these guys in Seattle… Pearl Jam?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Yeah, they end up sucking. Do yourself a favor and listen to more <a href="http://www.depechemode.com/">Depeche Mode</a> and less butt rock.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Dude, does music on the radio really get this bad?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: No, I think it has more to do with your tastes changing. Once you get to college, you'll discover that techno music is huge among techies, and after awhile it'll rub off on you. And then you'll discover <a href="http://www.stadler.org/KruderDorfmeister/">Kruder and Dorfmeister</a>, and everything else won't sound as good anymore. You'll still dig some other stuff, but mostly you'll want to play stuff like <a href="http://www.audiophonic.com/potf/">Pet of the Future</a>, <a href="http://www.loopz.co.uk/">Orbital</a>, <A HREF="http://the-raft.com/massive/index.mezz.html">Massive Attack</a>, <A HREF="http://www.hooverphonic.com/">Hooverphonic</a>, <A HREF="http://www.dirty.org/">Underworld</a> and <a href="http://the-raft.com/chemicalbros/">Chemical Brothers</a>.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: I've never even heard of those bands…

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Oh, and you'll find chick bands to be a guilty pleasure. Especially <A HREF="http://www.lisaloeb.com">Lisa Loeb</a>, <A HREF="http://www.KsChoice.com/">K's Choice</a> and <A HREF="http://www.lusciousjackson.com/">Luscious Jackson</a>.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: And you're sure that Nine Inch Nails aren't the best stuff ever anymore?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Yeah. After Downward Spiral, you won't hear anything from Trent at all for several years except for one little goth song on a soundtrack and some background stuff on a computer game.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: What about <a href="http://www.ubl.com/ubl_search.asp?search_type=Artist&text=big+daddy+meatstraw&src=Artist">Big Daddy Meatstraw</a>?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: In a few years you'll be the only person who remembers them.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Too bad, those guys rule.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: No, they don't.
