fun with Scott while he sleeps...

Scott: I love you...
Me: I love you too...
Scott: WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH THAT KEYBOARD?
Me: I'm not...?
Scott: Oh....I must be drunk...
Me: No you're not, you're fine.
Scott: OKEY-DOKEY!!

and he rolls over....meanwhile, I'm left wondering..okey-dokey? Scott never says that, WTF?

I've learned to just roll with his strange questions, and reassure him that the strange thing is not, in fact, happening, but okey-dokey is a new one...thank goodness we're never boring!
