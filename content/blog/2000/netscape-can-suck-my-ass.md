Okay. Netscape can suck my ass. I just caught a look at my new design for FTF in their sucky sucky 4.7 browser and it's all wrong!

Now, a casual observer might look at it and go "what? what's wrong? I don't see anything terrible!" But when you know exactly where things are supposed to be, you tend to notice things like the ENTIRE TABLE BEING 3/4 THE SIZE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! That and Netscape has apparently decided that the font I specified for the rest of the site doesn't apply to the counter text, Oh, that and none of the horizontal rules I put in are showing at all! Not to mention that Netscape doesn't show the background color of the tables in eburg or peons.

That's THREE major bugs right there! I know the problem is with Netscape because my code is all textbook. AAAAGH! Now some of you might be saying "Scott, shouldn't you calm down? I mean, Netscape will be coming out with a new version anytime now!." Admittedly, Netscape 6 doesn't seem to have any of these problems. BUT AS A WEB DESIGNER, I STILL HAVE TO DESIGN FOR 4.7's SHORTCOMINGS! Why? Because 90% of people never bother to upgrade their browsers!

I'm going to go buy a copy of the Anarchist's Cookbook and send Netscape a ticking package.
