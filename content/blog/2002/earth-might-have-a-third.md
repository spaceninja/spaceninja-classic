Earth might have a [third moon](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2251386.stm)! Now, I know what you're thinking... "Third moon? But I thought we only had two! Where did this third one come from?" Well, experts think it's a recent arrival - as recent as May!

What's that? You didn't even know Earth had a [second moon](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/second_moon_991029.html)? Well, then, [behold the glory](http://burtleburtle.net/bob/physics/cruithne.html) of [Cruithne](http://www.astro.queensu.ca/~wiegert/3753/3753.html), Earth's Second Moon!
