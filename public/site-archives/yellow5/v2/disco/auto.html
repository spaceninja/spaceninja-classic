<big>Auto Life Fire - Stinkfish Records</big>

<P>Auto Life Fire, released in February 1995, was the first official release from Yellow Number Five.  It was released on a local Portland label, Stinkfish Records, and consisted entirely of cover songs.  Most of the songs were altered in the cover, and the album had a distinctive, sample-heavy, pop feel to it.  Colossus referred to this album as their "light toast" record.  Ed confesses that to this day he still has no idea what Colossus meant by that.  This is the album that got the band noticed by Arrakis Records who signed them late in 1995.  This album was never a very large circulation, but if you can get to the Stinkfish headquarters in Portland, Oregon, you might still be able to buy a copy.
