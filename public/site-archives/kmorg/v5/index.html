This "design" was the status page I put online after the server crash in April 2004. It was updated with new information as I went through the recovery phase, and then eventually displayed the journal and forum archive tools that Miles wrote, by August 2004. Sometime in early 2005, the domain was transferred to Miles, and a "coming soon" page was put up in this page's place.

<p><strong>The Bad News:</strong> The server crashed hard early Friday morning, and it appears to have been scrambled in the process.</p>


<p><strong>The Good News:</strong> Data recovery efforts have been
proceeding well, and I am working on getting all the data hosted
somewhere so everyone can retrieve their journals.</p>

</div>


<div class="block">

<p><strong>The Full Story:</strong>
<br>On Friday the 16th, sometime between midnight and 3 A.M., we had a
power surge that caused the circuit breaker to trip, and we lost all
power. The 10-minute battery on the UPS quickly drained, and I didn't
hear the alarm from the bedroom. When I booted the server the next
morning, it quickly became obvious that it had been scrambled.</p>

<p>The server boots, but it says that it's unable to determine its
domain name, and is using 127.0.0.1 instead. When I log in locally,
everything goes slowly, and any network-related commands time out.
trying to read man files gives a screen full of garbage, and pressing
the arrow keys in any program results in error beeps and on-screen
garbage.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that I am not a sysadmin. I barely have a clue
what to do when the server is running fine, and this is pretty far
above my skill level. Common consensus among my geek friends seems to
be that the server will need to be reinstalled, which I am afraid of,
because I don't think I'll be able to get it back to the way it was
configured before.</p>

<p>Further complicating things is the fact that none of the data had
been backed up for several months. Frustratingly enough, researching
how to set up a cron job to do daily and weekly backups was on my to-do
list, and was probably going to get done in the next week or two. And
since I don't know if reinstalling or upgrading the OS will wipe out
files, my first goal had to be data recovery.</p>

<p>That at least seems to have gone smoothly. I was able to run
mysqldump to get a dump file of all the databases, and I was able to
tar-gzip all the web directories, home directories and mail
successfully. Then I was able to plug in a windows-formatted hard drive
and mount it to recover the files (I had to do it that way because I
had no network access). Those recovered files are now safe on two
separate computers, and I'll be working on extracting user data into
usable format and finding a place to host it over the next week.</p>

<p>I purchased some hosting to at least get a status message up for you
all so you don't think that I'm ignoring the problem or anything.</p>

<p>What's next? Well, I'll be taking it slowly trying to upgrade or
reinstall FreeBSD on the server. If I can get it working again, then
I'll put it back up as it was, and KillingMachines and all the other
sites will return shortly.</p>

<p>If I can't get it working again, then I'm probably still going to
try to try for about a month to get some form of server set back up
that can run KMorg. But if I can't get anything set up, then KMorg is
probably going to be shut down. The site was built around the fact that
it was running on its own server and had access to update the primary
DNS records every 15 minutes, which is not something I'll be able to
simulate on someone else's server.</p>

<p>I want to reassure you of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>I will do everything in my power to repair this server and get KillingMachines back online.</li>
<li>If KillingMachines goes offline, I will provide a way for you to
access a backup file of your journal. Your files and journals will not
just disappear.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, I have to warn you all that this server has been a pain in
my ass since the day that Steve abandoned it, and left me in charge of
all the services that the server was providing. This is not a job I
want, nor is it a job that I'm qualified for. While I will do
everything in my power to put KMorg back up and safeguard people's
data, everyone needs to remember that I'm having to do all of this in
my spare time after working my full-time job. I'm not asking for
sympathy, just understanding if it doesn't all happen overnight.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience. I'll let you know through this page if anything changes here.</p>

<p>-- Scott Vandehey</p>
