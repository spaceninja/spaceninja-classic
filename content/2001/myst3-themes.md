The Myst III themes I made are up (finally)!! They're _still_ not linked from [myst3.com](http://www.myst3.com/), but I assume they will be soon. Until then, you can find them on [download.com](http://download.cnet.com/downloads/0-1461915-100-4822668.html?tag=st.dl.10001-103-1.lst-7-1.4822668). For some reason, they posted the themes under the screensavers category, but I guess it doesn't matter because they've already got over 6000 downloads! The themes weigh in at a hefty 11MB, due to the extra wallpapers and the installer that Presto felt the need to add. The installer is kinda dorky, and doesn't give you any options, but I guess corporations feel nervous about giving their users options. It's still exciting to see that it's up! Once it's downloaded, if you look in the directory the themes are installed in, there's a link to spaceninja.com in the readme file! I kinda doubt I'll get many hits from the readme file that's buried in the install folder, but it's still very cool. And in case you don't want to wait for the download or install the themes, I posted screenshots on [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.local/downloads/myst3/).

**Edit:** The themes are no longer available on myst3.com or download.com, but you can check them out here at the [Space Ninja Downloads](http://spaceninja.local/downloads/myst3/) page.
