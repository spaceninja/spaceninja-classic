If you liked Gears 1, you'll like this one. It's more of the same, with slightly better graphics. One thing I liked is that there's a little more color. The world is still mostly brown and gray, but as they walk through cities and forests, you get to see that the Gears world is not, in fact, monochromatic. Absurd environmental features are still present (replace "krill" with "razorhail"), and the storyline is still non-existant, but the key bits that made the first game great are all there. Excellent cover mechanic and guns that are fun to fire. That crazy power chord that plays when you clear a room of enemies. And nutty over-sized boss fights. In fact, they pretty much open the game by throwing all the biggest monsters from the last game at you to establish that they have bigger ones to play with this time around. It's not a huge improvement over the first game, but it didn't need to be.
