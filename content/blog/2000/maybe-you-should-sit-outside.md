So I walk into my speech class this morning and the prof starts handing back the tests, sees me and goes "Oh, we're going to go over the test now, so maybe you should sit outside for a few minutes?"

What the hell? You're not letting me take the dumb test, bitch, why should I sit outside? (I say as much out loud, minus the profanity, which I save up all day for my hatelife journal) and she gives me an exasperated look and goes "Well, whatever."

I'm sick of school. I'm beyond ready to not have to do this crap anymore.
