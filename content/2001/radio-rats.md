Annie and I just got back from the radio station awards banquet. It was a semi-formal kind of thing, and they had pretty good food. When they started giving out awards, I got one for being the News Director, and Annie and I both got one for being in Troup O' Monkeys (the acting group who put on _War of the Worlds_ at the station). We were kind of expecting those, because they're just paper certificates that they gave out to everyone who was on management or in Troupe O' Monkeys. What we weren't expecting was to get one of the nice plaques they gave out for the DJ awards. They didn't give these to everyone, and we're new enough that we didn't think we would qualify. I'm not sure if we should be proud of the category we "won" in, though. Annie and I are now the award winning "Radio Rats." This is meant to symbolize that we're both constantly underfoot at the radio station, although the Program Manager assured me they meant it in a good way. Corey said it was also due to how much cheese we eat.
