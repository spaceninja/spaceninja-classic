Last night, we rented [Lagaan](http://www.lagaan.com/), an Indian film about a village that gets involved in a challenge to beat the local British cricket team in exchange for not having to pay their taxes for three years, but if they lose, they pay triple taxes. It's an underdog story, just like we're used to seeing from sports films here in the states, but with one crucial difference.  
  
This one's a four-hour long musical, sung in Hindi.  
  
It's awesome. I highly recommend it. Watch the [trailer](http://www.countingdown.com/theater/trailers_clips/detail/730726/), and then go rent it.
