Settlers of Catan, my [favorite board game](http://catanlive.com/) of all time is [coming to xbox live this week](http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/04/30/this-week-on-arcade-triplets-catan-centiped-eand-millipede.aspx)! I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am about this. My coworker Kelly also has a 360, so I'm sure I'll be playing with him. Unfortunately, like almost every xbox live title, I'm pretty sure it doesn't have any local multiplayer, so I'll need to talk all my other friends with 360s into buying the game, too.

For those who don't get the title - the game involves lots of trading, and two of the resources you trade are wood and sheep. It's easy to confuse people by saying something like "Who will trade wood for sheep?" and have two people hand each other wood, both thinking the other was offering sheep. So we've learned to use a more formalized phrase "I have X for Y" - which leads to the juvenile humor you see evidenced here. It's a great game, really.
