- [Portfolio](http://spaceninja.com/port/) Redesign - the design mockup is finished, I just need to convert it to CSS and upload. I'm actually aiming to have this one done tomorrow.
- [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) Installation - I'm looking to convert my blog, newsbeat, and Sean's site to wordpress, but I need to do a bit of experimenting with it first to ensure I can do what I need with it.
- [NewsBeat](http://www.newsbeat.org/) - Poor, neglected Newsbeat. Jill will murder me and hide my body in the woods if I don't finish everything I'm supposed to do. A complete overhaul to wordpress and a brand new design and logotype are in the works.
- [Dysnomia](http://dysnomia.spaceninja.com/) - David asked for a few minor design tweaks, which I should really sit down and take care of, since they will only take 15 minutes.
- [Nyarlo](http://nyarlo.net/) - Sean's site are due for a full conversion to wordpress, a new design, and a major overhaul of the site structure, which will relocated the blog to a new domain, set up a comic-posting system on another domain so he can focus on webcomics, and a photoblog/sketchblog for good measure. Plus a couple other things I'm probably forgetting. This will be a gigantic project, but also a lot of fun.
- [KillingMachines](http://www.killingmachines.org/) - I'm sure it's no suprise to anyone that I'm involved in some small way with the rebirth of KMorg, but I really need to find out how much I'm allowed to talk about before I go blabbing about it here. Watch the domain for further news.
- [Hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) - What? Who slipped that in here? Well, since I've had a few ideas for it, I may as well bring it back to life on it's new domain. A complete overhaul to wordpress as a back-end, and reposting of old comics will keep me busy for awhile, but I'd like to make some new comics soon, too.

It's a lot, but what the hell! I'm unemployed, what else do I have to do between submitting job apps to craigslist and playing World of Warcraft?
