<BIG>Apparition of Dr. Colossus sighted over Mt. Rushmore!</BIG>

<P>Mt. Rushmore � Visitors to the park were startled to see the well-known visage of Yellow Number Five's former frontman, the late Dr. Harmann Colossus floating over the mountainside sculpture. It was a clear day, and hundreds of witnesses reported that Colossus's massive floating head- roughly the same size as the sculptures- appeared over the head of Teddy Roosevelt, and stayed in place for roughly fifteen minutes.

<P>"My family and I were just visiting the park," quoted Jennel Thompson, a witness to the event. "I went to take a photo of the heads, and there it was, floating in the sky! This massive head with a fedora. I was really confused, and one of my kids asked me who it was. I said I didn't know and then the woman in front of us said that it was Dr. Enormous or something. I guess he used to be a singer in a rock and roll band."

<P>"This lady behind me had, like, no clue," said 19-year-old Wendy Burkert. "I used to follow Yellow Number Five everywhere! I went to all of their shows. I always stood in the front row and flashed them. One time, Dr. Colossus invited me backstage, but that girl Melissa threw me out. She was yelling something about jail-bait. Whatever� I totally wasn't going to sleep with all of them."

<P>A few photos were taken, but for the most part, any images came out extremely fuzzy or with unusual flares. By chance, one of our photographers, who asks to remain anonymous,  was on vacation, and happened to be on the site with his equipment. The majority of his images were useless, but one image came out perfectly clear. He had this to say about the incident:

<P>"It was really eerie. Everyone was snapping photos and getting all freaked out, and I just managed to start shooting really calmly. I heard this voice, though, that said that only one of my images would turn out. I got the impression that I had done something to the roll by mistake, and he (the big head) fixed one so there would be evidence of his appearance."

<P>After about fifteen minutes, the head gradually faded from sight. When witnesses asked park officials about the event, they said there was nothing they knew of that would cause such a mass hallucination, but reassured the crowd that they would check the water supply for possible contamination.
