We have mice. Again.

As we were sitting in the living room a mouse ran across the living room floor and scared the crap out of both of us. Now we're both irritated and startled, and having to pick up all of our stuff off the floor and trying to figure out whether it came in from outside or was living in the bed this whole time.

And now we have to buy traps again.

I **hate** having to take care of the dead mice in the traps. I hate it I hate it I hate it.

We're moving as soon as we have the money.

And we're getting rid of that damn bed.

Followup: We're also giving serious though to getting a cat, and to hell with what the landlord says.
