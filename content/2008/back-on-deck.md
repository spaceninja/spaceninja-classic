The first day back in the office after a vacation is always a bit overwhelming. I've been in the office for over two hours now, and I'm just now getting all caught up so I can get some work done -- and this was for a vacation when everyone else was out of the office, too.

While on break, I didn't read email or check my feed reader. Upon returning I hardly had any email, but I had over a thousand unread items in google reader.

I wish I had been able to write more blog posts recently, but between the holidays, visiting friends and family, playing video games, and taking care of a sick baby, it just didn't happen. I'll be fixing that this week, and the December newsletter will be up by the end of the week.
