Today I received this email from the second dumbest spammer in the world. Notice that there is no Subject, and no Message. However, there is a sentence typed into the From field. That's right. I got spam from the guy who was **Too Dumb To Use E-Mail**.

In case you're interested, the title of world's dumbest spammer is held by [Bernard Shifman](http://petemoss.com/spamflames/ShifmanIsAMoronSpammer.html)
