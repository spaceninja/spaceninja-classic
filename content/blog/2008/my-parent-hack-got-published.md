In the aftermath of Zoe's cold, [I sent a tip into Parent Hacks](http://www.parenthacks.com/2008/01/how-to-make-bab.html), and it got posted today!

> My ten-month-old daughter has a terrible cold right now, and she has developed a fear of the nose wipe. Anytime she sees me coming towards her with a rag or a kleenex, she turns her head away and hides - usually by rubbing her hands over her nose, spreading around everything I was about to wipe up.
>
> The trick I've discovered is that if I throw the rag over her face, like we're playing peek-a-boo, then I can quickly "pat" around her nose and mouth, and she still thinks it's a game.
>
> If I try to wipe, she figures it out, so the "pat" technique is important!
