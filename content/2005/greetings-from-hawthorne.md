I am blogging from the (empty) floor of my new apartment's living room! What's the best kind of bandwidth? Stolen, of course. Bless whichever of my neighbors left their wireless router unsecured, so I could log onto the internet and change my electricity and gas service to my name.

Anyways, I will post tomorrow night, hopefully with photos of our new place!
