check out the trailer for the new [full cgi appleseed movie.](http://apple.co.jp/quicktime/trailers/appleseed_large.html)

it's looks a little off since it's full-on realistic style, except deunan is blatantly based on shirow's art. but everything else looks fan-fucking-tastic. giant shirow robot monsters, hardsuits everywhere, briearos(sp?) looks great, and the movement is excellent.

still. i wish it was cel-shaded like stand alone complex.
