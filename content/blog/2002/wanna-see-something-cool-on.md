Wanna see something cool? On Monday afternoon (Sorry, I couldn't find the exact time anywhere), NASA-TV will broadcast live the images being beamed back from a webcam strapped to the outside of the primary booster tank for the shuttle launch. You can find a list of sites that broadcast NASA-TV on the web here:
