I want to get a webcam. Then everyone could stare at me staring blankly at my computer monitor... excellent.

Urn apparently has a digital camera (someone loaned it to him?). Anyways, Annie's really excited, because we're going to do something we've been wanting to do for awhile now. No, not dirty pictures... We're going to make a paper-doll kinda thing for her. It'll be awesome.

_Other 80s synonyms for good: fresh, awesome, radical, cool, bodacious (which the Central Washington Fair has based it's ad campaign around... yuk)._

Urn and I applied to be specialty show hosts. We want to take over the Industrial Trance show. I'm not sure what our chances are. On the one hand, they like us a lot, but on the other hand, I think they are nervous about giving the show to us, since we're so new, and the show has an established audience who expect certain things. Oh well. If they don't give it to us, we'll just have to keep kicking ass as ordinary DJs.

Hopefully, annie and kat will start getting into this site soon. Urn and Pat and I all post elsewhere, so it's not really exciting or new to see us posting here, but the girls don't post anywhere yet. It'll be cool to get "the female viewpoint." Kat's already said she wants to post, if for no other reason than to correct Urn.
