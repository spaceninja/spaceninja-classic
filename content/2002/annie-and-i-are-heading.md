Annie and I are heading north to visit our friends Eric and Jill and their son Gavin.  
  
Also, I have modified Rusted to use the new permalink feature (as in "permanent link" for those of you not following the jargon), which will allow linking directly to any post on the system, something it was lacking before.  
  
Coming very soon: User icons.
