> Morpheus offers Neo two pills. One will return him to his drone existence, while the other will open his mind to the Matrix so he can learn what the hell is going on. It doesn't take a degree in Miltonic studies to understand that any red-blooded action hero will choose the hit of acid over the tranquilizer.

Wow, this [movie review](http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/reviews/1999/04/02reviewa.html) _sucks._

The reviewer has such a limited concept of what movies can be about.

A movie doesn't have to have character development to be good. That's only needed if it specifically sets out to tell a _story._

Does propaganda need character development?

Does a boxing match need character development?

Does [Simulacra and Simulation](http://www.uta.edu/english/apt/collab/texts/hollywood.html) need character development?

The above review _did_ make me laugh.

But THIS is more like it:

> Neo is both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, good and evil, noble and ridiculous. But he is not outside the system, he is embraced and engulfed by it because the reality he is fighting for, no longer exists - it is a utopia, an ancient legend.
