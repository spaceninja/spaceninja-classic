One of my favorite things about college is the bathroom graffiti. I'm used to the usual "For free sex call:" or "Billy sucks dick here on fridays!" stuff that you see elsewhere. College is the only place where I see people have complete conversations entirely in the form of graffiti. I swear to god, in the men's room stall in one of the buildings on campus, there was an economics debate, complete with complex economics vocabulary interspersed with swearing and insults. It was awesome. Unfortunately, some short-sighted janitor painted over it, so I will now present you with the graffiti currently gracing the stall in the building I work in. Each quote is one piece of writing, with all of its responses following it.

"Jesus Died For Your Sins"

"no he didn't, ralph did!"

"considering my sins, that's still a bargain."

"accept him into your heart and go to heaven!"

"accept him into your heart and go to heaven! Gresham"

"accept him into your heart be baptized and go to heaven! Gresham"

"accept him into your heart be baptized in the toilet and go to heaven! Gresham"

"I wonder how Jesus feels about defacing school property?"

"She likes it!"

"So God is dead, I thought so."

"I want to drink your blood"

"Rexzilla fuck dat shit for life"
