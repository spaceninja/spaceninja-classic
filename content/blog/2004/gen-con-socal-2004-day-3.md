Today started out smooth and deadly. Everything was going great. I tested printing everywhere, and everything worked. There were some network difficulties due to the convention center's setup, so I went to lunch with Dave, and we figured we'd be playing World of Warcraft by early afternoon.

Well, things didn't go quite according to plan. Around 3pm, we found out that credit card processing wasn't working. To make a long story short, the boys worked on it for the next eight hours, and we only just now got out of there, after confirming that everything works.

Tomorrow, we have to get up at 5am to make sure we've confirmed our testing before registration opens at 7am.

Bleagh. Anyways, as bad as today went, it's done, everything works, we're all home by midnight, and the rest of the week should go smoothly, and leave lots of time to spend in the game LAN.
