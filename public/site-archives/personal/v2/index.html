<p>This was the second version of my homepage, and it was called "Grog and Trog's Virtual Whatever." It was no longer hosted on geocities. Instead, Trog and I both got accounts with spiritone.com for email, and I used the provided hosting. It was entirely hand-coded at this point, using tutorials from webmonkey, though I don't remember anything about the design.</p>

<p>This version was online for a year or two, and over time lots of content was added, including photos of Trog and I, a guestbook (which is <a href="http://www.htmlgear.tripod.com/guest/control.guest?u=spaceninja&a=view&i=1001">still online</a>), and a humor section, which consisted of funny text files that we found on the internet or we got via email. Most of this content was carried over to version three, which was just a personal site again.</p>
