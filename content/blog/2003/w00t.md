I just got done talking to my friend Eric in Washington, and it turns out that he got accepted to [Warner Pacific College](http://www.warnerpacific.edu/), so he and Jill and Gavin will be moving to Portland this summer! It's great news for them, because Warner Pacific is supposed to have an incredibly high job placement rate, so the odds are good that upon graduation, Eric would be able to get a job quickly (they've had trouble finding steady employment since Ellensburg). It's also great for Annie and I, because we hung out with Eric and Jill on an almost daily basis the whole time we were in Ellensburg, so the idea that we could be seeing them more frequently is very exciting... and just another reason why [2003 is going to be a great year](/blog/2003/2003-is-going-to-be-a-great-year/)!
