I guess Galactica ran a minute or two over its scheduled timeslot, because my Replay cut off the last minute of it. Appearently enough people had the same problem with their Tivos (and, presumably, VCRs), that [SciFi has put the last few minutes of the season final online](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/video_popup/index.html), so you can watch it if you missed it. via [powazek](http://powazek.com/)
