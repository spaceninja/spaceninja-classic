"On two occasions, I have been asked \[by members of Parliament\], 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question."  
\-- Charles Babbage (1791-1871)
