i wonder what cosmic significance there might be to having launched my professional music career on the winter solstice.

well, in any event, the show was great..people want our cd (which doesn't exist), want to know when we're playing next (nothing confirmed yet), and were overall very responsive. i'll let you all know when our next one is coming up.

and the prediction i'd made to myself 18 months ago came true- that within 18 months of picking up an instrument, i'd play music in a band. it happened about two weeks shy of 18 months.
