Inspired by the recent reanimation of [Isometric](http://isometric.sixsided.org/), I've put [Hammerspace](https://archives.spaceninja.com/hammerspace/v2/) back online, and you can find it at its new permanent home, [hammer.spaceninja.com](https://archives.spaceninja.com/hammerspace/v2/).

In the long run, I'm planning on changing the setup so that it would be easier for me to post new strips and keep the older ones organized. For now, I've just uploaded the old site as it existed in my last archive. Enjoy!
