soo...everything sucks again...was I always this extreme?

I'M ON CRUTCHES!!!! I CAN'T F'CKING BELIEVE THIS!!

anywhoo...man, if one more person calls me gimpy I swear I'm going to break their knees with one of them...actually, I won't, I can't stand violence now more than ever...

I'm just so sick of feeling helpless, especially when yesterday I thought I was doing great and then it all fell apart after "work". I was in an intense amount of pain yesterday afternoon and it even woke me up from a nap. you know it's bad when I have a hard time napping... I had my foot elevated, with ice and I had taken my ibuprofen but it didn't help. I told Scott if I still was so distracted by pain after he came back from his errand that we were going back to the hospital because I didn't know what else to do. I thought I was going to faint trying to get out of bed and going downstairs. It was worse then when I initially sprained it practically. the nurse at the hospital (same one I went to initially on the 12th), was really surprised that they didn't give me crutches right away, and that I absolutely was putting too much weight on it and to stay off of it.

arrgghh...so I guess I'm just going to be lame for Halloween this year...this is getting so frustrating, and it's hard to keep it all in perspective some days. fortunately, scott and his family have been really supportive of me putting up with my crankiness. the guys at work have been awesome too, but I get so cranky when I'm not social... It's like I don't even want to hear about all the cool stuff my team is doing because it's too depressing, I don't even feel like I'm part of a team anymore.

I finally got accepted to the portland car-sharing thing so I have access to a car when I need one, and I want to help out places for my light duty work, but getting anywhere is so difficult that it's almost not worth it to leave the house some days...and now they're telling me NOT too...I keep getting back into this really depressed cranky state and I hate it.
