Guh... I am so brain-dead right now. I just got off the phone from what should have been a 45 minute to an hour-long phone call, at most, with some clients on the east coast. It took over two hours. Their network was really slow (I guess the blizzard?), so it took twice as long to do anything, we barely covered the required ground, and by the end I don't think they were even hearing anything I was saying. I kept explaining things, and there would be silence. I'd ask "does that make sense?" and get a quiet chorus of yeahs. Ugh. I **must** write some documentation so I can reduce the frequency of these training calls.
