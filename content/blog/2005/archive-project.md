The Archives Project is underway! My goal was to get this all done and written up by the five-year anniversary, but obviously I missed that. Still, I figure it counts as long as I get it done this year. Anyways, here's what I'm talking about.

My goal is to do a nice writeup of my involvement on the internet for my about page, but to do it right, I wanted some screenshots of my early websites. So I'm busy pulling together a complete archive of my major sites, and all their designs. Plus, if I lay the groundwork now, then I can keep the archive going easily whenever I redesign a site.

So if you're interested in this kind of thing, check out the [Archives Project](/site-archives/) to see what I have so far.

Still to come: archives of my previous blog designs, and kmorg, as well as the nice writeup I mentioned above, and a good splash page and table of contents for the archives project itself.
