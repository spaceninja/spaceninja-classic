1. Domain: http://www.oscorp.net registered until 2003-05-07

It's kind of silly to make that a link, since the domain probably won't become active for a couple days, but I'm excited! When I checked if oscorp was available, I didn't really expect it to be. People usually snatch up movie-related domains right away. But there it was! And now it's mine.

Now I just need to decide what to put on it. Suggestions, anyone?
