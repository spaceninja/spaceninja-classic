[**Weenie Roast**](http://bdmonkeys.net/).

Probably our most chaotic, and (coincidentally) best album to date. I recommend tracks 1, 6, 8.

Those of you familiar with blackflag's Darby/Bergamot slash fiction will get a kick out of the triple shot of Bergamot tracks...

Anything else is playing with sacred fire ;)
