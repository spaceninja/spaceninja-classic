[![](/images/mozillaicon.gif)](http://spaceninja.local/downloads/mozicon/mozilla.ico)I am making this post using [Mozilla Version 1](http://www.mozilla.org/)! The final release is out, and it's great. Tabbed browsing, the most accurate markup engine on the market, and it views my Aqua skin correctly! In fact, the only thing about it that I don't like is the ugly ugly blue gecko icon they made for it. It looks bad at full size, and it's practically useless at the smaller size used on the taskbar. Lucky for me, I've got a much better icon! You can have this icon too, by right-clicking on the image and selecting "save target as." Presto! An easy way to add class to your Mozilla!

I decided to post [a screenshot of how great Mozilla 1.0 is](/images/blog-photos/goodlooking.jpg). Notice the custom icon on the titlebar? I did that using a program call ResHack. The theme is called Orbit, and you can get it [here](http://www.mozdev.org/redirect/themes/).

Oh, and probably the coolest feature in Mozilla? You can set it up so that it doesn't allow sites to open unrequested windows! No more popup ads! To do this, go to Preferences > Advanced > Scripts & Windows and deselect "Open Unrequested Windows."
