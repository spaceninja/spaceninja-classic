And the progress just keeps on rolling! Tonight I set up the last two big projects on my to-do list.

First of all, I set up [NewsBeat.org](http://www.newsbeat.org/) with a basic MT 2.662 installation. There's still a lot of work to be done to make it look and feel more like a proper news site, but the hard part is done, and from here on out it's just tweaking.

Secondly, I as you may have noticed, I moved Rusted from [rusted.killingmachines.org](http://rusted.killingmachines.org/) to [spaceninja.com/blog](/). I did this for a variety of reasons, including so that I have more freedom to decide what to do with killingmachines.org. As long as Rusted was sitting on that domain, I had limited options. Now that the domain is fully free, I can do anything I want, including the possibility of handing the domain off to a new owner who would treak it the way it deserves to be treated. I'm not sure about it, but that will give me options.

Just like the other sites I put up last night, there's still some tweaks and updates to be made, but on the whole, the site is set up and ready to rock.

Up next: design work and photo posts!
