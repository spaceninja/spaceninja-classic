Well, the worst of my cold seems to have passed (Oh, by the way, I was sick all weekend). And now I'm horribly behind at work and my boss is irritated at me because I didn't call in sick on Sunday. Blah blah blah sick blah blah this post is boring me. Tonight Steve and I upgrade Rusted. More details later.
