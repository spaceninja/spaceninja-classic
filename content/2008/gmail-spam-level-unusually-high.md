Is anyone else seeing a dramatic increase in spam in their gmail account? I typically get between 150-200 spams a day, but the last two days I've gotten around 550. The overwhelming majority of them are the postmaster bounce messages, which leads me to suspect someone is using my address in a massive spam campaign.

One of my coworkers is also seeing this on his account, so I was wondering if it was happening to anyone else. The one nice thing is that gmail's fantastic spam filter isn't having any trouble - I had _three_ spams in my inbox this morning, and all the rest were properly filtered.
