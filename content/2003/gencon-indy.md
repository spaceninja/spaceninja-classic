I just found out that I'll be going to Indiana for a week later this month! One of our clients is GenCon, and they're having one of their conventions over there, so Mogenns and I will be flying out to provide support for the servers and other software we've written for them. Should be interesting. Anyone know of anything cool to see in Indiana?
