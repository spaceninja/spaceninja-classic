man, tons of stuff going on. aside from the weedings i'm attending and being involved in and flying out of state to crash, work is hectic in that i have my main freelance peeps who give me a full work week, and i now have an additional client good for even more regular hourage per week. piled on top of that is the usual fiddle & dog care. and i'm still the most frequent poster to rusted here! ;)

i'm making some server changes soon, cause i've now got access through my professional contacts to professional hosting, and it seems we've some work to do to work out the details of these changes.

i've also unearthed the long-dormant sense of satisfaction of being disciplined and enjoying the payoff of such. i've started writing real hand-written letters to people who live across the country, and dedicating time to finishing dense and difficult books, no matter how dense and difficult they may be. (and i've just finished up my quick cataloging applet, so i can start entering in my library of books and records onto an web-viewablw list..)

oh, gotta run..
