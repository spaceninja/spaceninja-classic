Yooh! Time for webComic links. The strips listed below are all drawn in the (Japanese) manga style, except for Bruno. All links will open in a new window, so click away! Let's start with the purest strip and descend into Hell from there.

[Bruno \[Chris Baldwin\]](http://brunostrip.com/archive.html) So Bruno is this girl, see, and she's got this problem about the meaning or lack of meaning of life, see...

By Chris Baldwin, a member of the "one big panel" school of cartooning. The above link goes to the Bruno Archives, because his stuff just isn't that funny after 1998. (I love you, Chris, but you know it's true.) However, if you start from 1996 you will be hooked and your speech/thought patterns will change permanently and you will have to read every goddam strip. That is the **power** of Bruno.

[Silence Comic \[Motoi Motoni\]](http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Kouen/4091/sindex.htm) Pretty cute. No dialog or sound effects at all; just visual jokes. I call that using the visual medium correctly. And it loads instantaneously, because it's in 1-bit black and white.

[SinFest](http://sinfest.net) Pimpin'. Mad pimpin. _Caligula_ pimpin.

A mixture of Calvin and Hobbes, Bloom County, and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka; with a subtle Jack Chick influence to round out the mix.

[Irritability \[Mike Woodson\]](http://wntapp.cc.utexas.edu/~IFQY342/comicpage/index1.html) Anime, RPG, and B-movie influences abound. But the author has so thoroughly fused them, that something... _different_ emerges.

[Irritability on a good day](http://wntapp.cc.utexas.edu/~IFQY342/comicpage/I269.gif)

[Irritability on a bad day](http://wntapp.cc.utexas.edu/~IFQY342/comicpage/I271.gif)

As you can see, both rule.

[Damaged \[Locke\]](http://damaged.anime.net) Angst.

You can almost hear Locke saying, "I'll make my site just like the world: FUCKED UP and impossible to navigate. Those who cannot take the pain do not deserve what's hidden inside." We hate you, too, Locke. ^\_^

But when someone can do [this](http://damaged.anime.net/comics/bend/bend001.gif) on a routine basis, I tend to put up with them.

Nevertheless, for the weak, here are direct links to his incredible [_Ride,_](http://damaged.anime.net/comics/ride/) and his occasionally jaw-dropping [one-off illustrations.](http://damaged.anime.net/junk.htm)

Locke's cityscapes are as intricate as Masamune Shirow's. I think I see some Katsushiro Otomo influence in there, too. His characters are a bit more modern, though, than either of those artists'; they bear the stamp of anime more than of manga. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, it's not important.

[Thin H Line \[Clay\]](http://clay.simplenet.com/thl/index.html) Sick, sick, sick. You're over 18, right? The "H" in "Thin H Line" refers to a Japanese loan-word meaning "sexually perverse," and this comic revolves around the crossing of that line. "I'm sure that at some point this strip will be used against me in court," Clay writes. But in actuality, he's a sensitive soul. Reading THL will hardly scar you at all.

[Tang's Weekly \[Tang\]](http://tang.simplenet.com/wc/wc.html) The art's clumsy, and so is Tang's English, but the broken-ness of it appeals to me. In a way, it almost works like [Pokey.](http://yellow5.com/pokey) The humor isn't so much in the strips, as in the the mental image you develop of the lunatic writing them. For example: [Little Girl vs. Big Corporation](http://tang.simplenet.com/wc/wc_archive/wc092.gif)
