Every year, I pick a bunch of stupid resolutions, and I never manage to stick with them. So this year, I'm keeping it simple:

**No Soda at my Desk:** I typically drink two or three cans of soda every day. Water in the morning, but then I'll have a soda with lunch, and I'll keep drinking soda until I leave the office. In the past, I've tried giving up caffeine or soda entirely, and failed. Instead, I'm just going to say that I'm not allowed to have soda at my desk. If I want one with lunch, that's no problem, but when I leave the breakroom, I'm done with the soda, and I'm only drinking water at my desk.

**Upload all Photos to Flickr:** I've got about five years' worth of digital photos on my computer, and for the last couple years, I've been uploading the good ones to Flickr. The problem is that I've been doing it a little bit at a time, and I'm taking photos faster than I've been uploading them. So I've got all my photos from 2003 and 2004 uploaded, and everything since Zoe was born, but nothing between there. So my goal is to finish the job this year so that going forward, I only have to deal with new photos. Plus, then Annie and I can print up photo books of our old photos!

Wish me luck!
