W00t! Tech support wrote me back! Admittedly, it was a full 24 hours later, and it was just to ask for more details and warn me that it sounds like an "incompatability problem," but since I wasn't expecting any reply at all, I'm still excited. I just wish I wasn't having to start the tech support procedure right before leaving town for a week.
