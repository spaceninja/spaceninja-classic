They just cleaned the windows in the office where I work, and there's apparently a good-sized ledge outside the windows, because we look up and there's this guy standing out there, three floors up (with fairly high ceilings, too), washing the windows with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. Then he just opens the window from outside and steps in to clean the inside windows. When he finished, he just stepped back out and closed the window.

This raises three thoughts:

2. Is he that casual about it when he's standing on the fifth floor, too?

3. If the windows can be opened from the outside, what happens when the army of evil flying ninjas invades New York? Will they simply open all the windows and wreak havoc from the third floor down? Can the windows in my apartment be opened from outside? What do you say to someone who's just opened your window and is standing on your windowsill?

4. We've either been watching the Matrix too much lately or not enough.
