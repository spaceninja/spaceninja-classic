> **Annie:** What in the world is a WYSIWYG editor? **Scott:** Oh, it stands for "What You See Is What You Get." It means one of those editors where when you make text bold or increase the font size, you can see the changes on-screen, like Microsoft Word. **Annie:** Oh... I had no idea what you were talking about. That post made no sense at all. **Scott:** Yeah, sorry about that. I guess that post was really aimed more at people in my industry than family and friends. **Scott:** I try to balance between the two groups, and I guess I just figure that when I post about work stuff that family members will just skip over those posts, and that my coworkers skip right over the posts about Zoe. **Annie:** Makes sense. **Scott:** You know, really, I guess my blog has a target audience of one: Urn.

Actually, my target audience includes guys like Dave and Daniel, but the joke was funnier this way, so too bad.
