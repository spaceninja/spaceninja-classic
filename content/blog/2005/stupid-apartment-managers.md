USPS finally delivered my copy of Jade Empire today, but I'm not playing it right now. That's because the apartment offices (where the package was left) are closed, even though their posted hours are 9am to 9pm. They've been closed since I got home at 6:30pm.

I've gotten many packages over the last two weeks (an order of used books from Amazon), and almost every night I've found the office closed when I get home at 6:30pm. Usually, however, when I check again around 7:30 or 8pm, they're open. The person working has just decided to get some dinner.

That irritates me too, but I can understand how it is with only one person on shift. Still, they should only be gone for 15 minutes or so - long enough to get food and then come back and eat in the office. And at the least, they should put up a sign saying they'll be back at such and such a time.

But tonight, they weren't there at all. No sign, no note, nothing. The office is just closed for no reason. And as a result, I can't get my package, and I can't play my game.

Tomorrow I'm going to talk to the manager. I'm tired of this bullshit.
