In case you're like me, and missed it, you should know that Miles released episode one of _The Better Ninja_ over at [Isometric](http://isometric.sixsided.org/), and it's great. Fantastic work by both Miles and Zach, and it looks like the series is only going to get better. Go check it out now! Then you can say "I knew Miles back when he was a two-bit hack, who didn't even animate in 24 full frames a second, and his stuff was STILL better than most big-budget movies!"
