I've had several people ask me for this lately, so I thought I'd post it here:  
  
There are a whole slew of crummy matrix-style screensavers available for PC, and I've used almost all of them, from the flash-based one on [thematrix.com](http://www.thematrix.com/) to a really really gross text-based one that just barely resembled the matrix at all.  
  
The best matrix screensaver ever made is called xmatrix, and it's a unix screensaver for xwindows. I've been jealous of this ever since I first saw the unix team running it a few years ago.  
  
Happily, someone ported it to PC, and the PC version is GREAT. This is easily the best PC-based matrix screensaver avialable. You can find it here: \[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/matrix32/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/matrix32/)\]
