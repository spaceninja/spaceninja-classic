         Hi there Scott-

Remember me?  I'm the guy who was constantly getting kicked out of Cromley-sensei's class.  Remember?  The tall guy who you were enormously attracted to?  That's right, it's me.  I looked at your portfolio page and I dare say it looks damned good.  A lot better than my bitch art student ex-girlfriend's portfolio.  Of course this is an objective comparison.  That goddamned bitch.

love,
Dan<!--http://saturn.guestworld.tripod.lycos.com/wgb/wgb.dbm?owner=grog1-->

   Where o' where do I fit into your future royal palace? As a typical Aires that of course must be my first question, and as a red-head it must be asked directly. Surely you can find a room filled with men, music, videos, and endless Dr. Pepper for little ol' me....

I do hope it pleases you leader that i am signing your guestbook now.  I couldn't help but notice the dramatic remodeling that has taken place since my last visit, o supreme one.  I have not completely finished the viewing of all the many abundances that are here in this newly upgraded place , but i did however find some things i liked and i found some things to keep my coming back until i have perused through every single parcel in the place. That is , if that is how you wish master sir.   I would like to take this opportunity to express my complete greed for your wonderful imaginative skills.  I hope you will not have me terminated for saying so , as it is truly meant to be a compliment.  I would also like to add that it would please me if you were in touch more.  Who knows ... that might please you as well, but that's a totally different story.

Good Night

have classes every day.  I got your really NEAT-O card
(thanx bunches buddy!).  If you talk to Kermit at all tell
her hi and to give me a ring: (541) 754 80 29
Take care of yourself, come visit me here in Corvallis, the
guys wouldn't mind with an x-tra body in the house (esp.
when I am entertained and not being grumpy towards them --
they do deserve it!)

         Grog & Trog!!
I come home soon.  In a little less than 4 weeks.  It'll be the 29 or 31.  I've got some exciting news (I don't know if I've told you, some I'm waiting).  I don't have a foggy clue as to what I am going to do with my life when I come back to Oregon (it's no longer "home" to me), I'm thinking about studing to become an EMT and do that for a while and then go to OSU in the fall and live with some of my boys from BSA Camp.  My life, man, I'm trying to imagine this whole leaving this country and I just can't.  I have roots here now.  I no longer am that sad and depressed Tide that wanted to go back to Oregon, now I am this chick that wants to explore for the rest of her life going off to foreign lands and meeting new people and getting tan and hearing different languages in my ears.  You have to do it someday, go traveling (and I mean aside from the everyday road-trip) and see the world, it's so fun and it helps you grow and see things that you never would have seen before.  You learn to appreciate life and all it has to give.
Sorry to be babbling, it's rather common with me.
I can't wait to see you both.  Hoping for a foccaci bread and/or pizza at our place (I misss American pizza sooooo much).  We will have to do that before winter term starts, maybe we could even have a slumber party!
Yeah, yeah, I'm going now.

WHAT?!?  Do you think that I am lame because I don't have my own web page?!  Well, I don't want it!  Yeah, so there!!!!

Love and hugs and wugs and even some mugs,

Are you still angry with her? Things have changed now for you, haven't they? You guys are a little slow. The only new thing was Grog's writing. I really miss you and need a big hug. I want to cry. I'm so lonely. Help!! Save me! ACK!!!! Who knows if I will stay here longer. The Gods of th airplane will decide that and maybe the Passport control people will have something to say about it too. But I don't have much to come home to. And not a whole lot here to stay for. I just will. I think I am on my way to writing a novel in your poor guestbook, sorry. I love you. -Tide

Didn't think you would want your "old aunt's" name on your site.
Why is it that Trog thanks his paretns but you only remember
your current friends?  Doesn't really matter.  I enjoyed your
drawings.  I tend to like the ones which aren't quite so black.
As you know I am definitely not a minimalist.  Good luck on
your apartment move.  Is there anything you want from Mexico?
That is our next trip.  (No we will not bring tequila, we are
only allowed so much and we are out at home.)
We will probably see you this summer.
Take care-Michelle
PS  Have I met Trog before?  If so tell him hi and good luck
on living with you.

I think I saw scott a few weeks ago at denny's, but I didn't want to interrupt his high-class dining because he was in the company of some young maiden.  I made a couple of conspicuous noises, hoping he'd turn around and notice me (farting loudly, yelling at Arnell the polypenesian waiter), but to no avail.  Oh well, basil says he always sees that feller around, so methinks it shouldn't be too long before I runs into him again.  Oh, and, by the by, has either of you seen cromely sensei lately?  Apparently he isn't just thinner than he used to be: he's downright thin, period.  I asked my sister about him and she said, "Who? that skinny old man?"  Hmm...

I hope to catch a showing of "Three Penny" as I'm sure the set will be faaabbulous!  :)  Not to mention, most of the theatre dept. is in it.

         <!--http://www.lpage.com/wgb/wgb.dbm?owner=grog1-->Dear Grog and Trog:  Hello guys.  I was looking through a
friend's email, and came across your page link again.  I
thought I would sign the guestbook, and then I came across
the entry I wrote last time.  I truly apologize for the
misconception that I had.  I realize now that I have the
wrong set of people.  I spoke with a guy named Trog, and he
told me that he was moving in with a straight guy, and he
would turn the straight guy gay, after they had their first
sexual experience.  After going over your page, I see that
you are both straight, and I must have the wrong Trog.  The one
I spoke with said that his roommate was bi-curious, and that
he would, over time, convince him that bisexuality and gay
sex would change his life forever.  I don't think I have the
same group of roommates, because Grog has a girlfriend from
his response, and Trog is looking for one.  Trog also said that
he could get his roommate to kiss him when he drinks, and he never
did say is roommate would have the nick Grog.  I am so sorry
that I got the wrong people.  Please forgive my mishap, and have fun
in 1998.  Take care, Jacob Saunders.

Hello guys....  so glad to see your web page.  So impressed with the work.  You have done an excellent job.  You deserve a slap on the ass for this one.  So glad to hear that you have found a roommate.  I am so glad that you have found yourself a mate.  I know you have been seeking for some time now. Glad to see Trog that you have found someone that has fullfilled all of your fantasies(blowjobs, eating each other out and anal sex).  It;'s the greatest if you find the right partner. Well I can't wait until us gays finally can get married to oour lovers.  That would be so wonderful.  I am praying for the day when that comes.  Can't wait to marry Jamie my sweety.  Once again congrats. on the page, great job guys.

Take Care,
Jacob Saunders
P.S.  You two look like your inlove.....  Great pics. guys.

<p>GROG & TROG's RESPONCE: um... we're not in the business of censoring our guestbook entries, believing that everyone has a right to express an opinion... But in this case, we feel a need to reply... We are not involved with each other. Grog has a girlfriend, and Trog is currently looking for someone... We are just old friends from High School who are moving out together to get out of our parent's houses.  Sorry to disappoint.

to understand.  Now, what's this about me causing problems
with the USA and Canada.  *giggling*  Would I do that?  Guess
I told you about me dancing in the US bars on July 4th, wearing
my Canadian flag Undies... right?  *embarrassed, but not really*

Keep up the good work guys, and I wish you all the best with
the new apartment.  Trust me, you are going to have the time of your
lives!  Just don't fight, got it!  ~smile~
