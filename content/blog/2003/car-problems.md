I'm still in Washington! Annie and I were going to do our usual Christmas Eve with her family and Christmas Day with my family. She drove Eric and Jill's car up earlier in the week, and we hung out with her family the whole time. Christmas Eve was great, and Christmas morning we got up and had fun and packed the car. Annie wanted to move the car so we could pack more easily, when she noticed that there was no resistance on the brake pedal.

So her dad checked it out, and discovered that the rear brakes were completely shot, and all the brake fluid had drained into the wheel wells. So, Annie jumped on a train this morning to go home so she could make her scheduled work shifts, while I hang out up here, until the car is fixed (truthfully, I could catch a train, but I can work from up here, and I already missed Christmas with my family, so I'm not in a huge rush to get home).

This in addition to the debacle with the windshield wipers have added up to a pretty unpleasant car experience this holiday.

Still, as many people have pointed out, we're both safe and warm, and we didn't get stranded on the freeway, or worse yet, get involved in a wreck due to our brakes.
