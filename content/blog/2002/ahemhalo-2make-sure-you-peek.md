(make sure you peek at the [screenshots](http://www.bungie.net/site/1/site/halo/features/screenshots.html), as Halo 2 looks like a billion times better than the first one).

Today I'm going to Fry's, where I am finally exiting the stone age by purchasing a CD Burner. I'm also going to buy a new video card, which should extend the life of my PC, at least in terms of playing games on it.

The gaming weekend at the Stockman household was great fun. We had a total of 7 computers and an Xbox. Annie's got some of the [photos](/images/lan_party_i/) we took up on her website, \[[http://www.strawberrystudios.org/](http://www.strawberrystudios.org/)\]. She's even got one where it looks like [I'm teaching Noah how to dance](/images/lan_party_i/scott_noah.jpg).

Yesterday I went to get lunch at Chu's with Steve and Miles. The older lady that we always see there recognized Steve (and called him by name!), so we all introduced ourselves. She's really nice, and it just makes Chu's that much cooler now that Steve's a "regular." I've got to start eating there more often.

Steve and Miles were talking about the difficulties they're encountering with their business venture, \[http://www.dining-local.com/\]. So, being the experienced salesman that I am (haha), I offered them some advice. They were both wearing fairly normal clothes, so I suggested dressing up a bit, so they would seem more serious... But, as they patiently explained to me, they actually got better responses by dressing down. When they went in nice clothes, the owners "Saw them coming a mile away," as Miles put it. They said that I wasn't the first one to try to tell them that, so I didn't feel quite so dumb after that, but it's always interesting when someone has experience that goes against what you've always been told. I wonder if it has something to do with them selling websites... Maybe people don't expect or want websites from a "suit." Maybe you see a younger guy in normal clothes, and you take him a little more seriously as a web guy? Anyways, I thought it was interesting.
