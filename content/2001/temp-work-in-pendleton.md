Well, as of tomorrow, I'm off to Pendleton for a few days. What's in Pendleton, you ask? _\[insert sarcastic comment about small town here\]_ Ha ha ha! Seriously, though, there's a DEQ office. Apparently the LAN Admin at this office quit recently, and while they've been trying to replace him, a backlog of work has built up to the point where they asked my dad to go over for a few days and try to get things running again. As this will mostly consist of installing new workstations, they'll need some tech-chimps who are capable of following directions, so I'm tagging along.

I'm getting nervous about the possible job with Steve's boss. I haven't heard anything from him in about a week, and I'm afraid I let my hopes get up. It really would be the perfect job, and I know I'll be disappointed if I don't get it. So, even though the idea of spending a few days in Pendleton doesn't exactly thrill me, it will let me get out and do something other than wait for a phone call or email.
