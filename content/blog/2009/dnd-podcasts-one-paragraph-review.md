[![The Jim Darkmagic Magic](/images/3405610494_19fd4b048d.jpg)](http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4arch/pod 'The Jim Darkmagic Magic by spaceninja, on Flickr')

Long story short: Gabe and Tycho, the guys who make [Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/) and Scott, who makes [PvP](http://pvponline.com/), are playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons being run by Chris Perkins from the R&D section at Wizards of the Coast (who make D&D). They recorded those sessions, and put them online as podcasts. Even if you have no interest in D&D, these guys are _hilarious_, and the game only gets better when [Wil Wheaton](http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/) joined in. An example of the funny: Gabe is playing an egotistical wizard named Jim Darkmagic, and in the course of literally every battle, manages to light Scott's dwarf on fire. Over time, it becomes a running joke that when they enter a room, the first thing Jim does is light the dwarf on fire. If you enjoy Penny Arcade, PvP, or Dungeons and Dragons, you owe it to yourself to [listen to these podcasts](http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4arch/pod).
