wow, hah. i've been taking my fiddle to work to practice on my lunch hour the last few weeks, and the last few days i've gone out into the woods with pi to practice after work, too. today the darndest thing happened! a white-haired gentleman in his late 40s stopped to listen.. after i finished a set of scottish tunes, he started to make small-talk, and then he sprung this on me: "so.. i work part-time for a recording studio. have you thought about making a cd? if not, we're always looking for people to call on as backup musicians. would you be interested in coming in to record?"
