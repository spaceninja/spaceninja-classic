Well, it was snowing the morning, which was cool right up until the point where I had to bike to work. In addition to being cold and wet, I had snow blowing in my eyes, so that I couldn't see. However, the end result of this is that I bought some cool sunglasses at Bi-Mart. They're yellow! Now I will be able to see in the snow! Hooray!

I'm all angsty about the election. I won't get into it, since I'm sick of hearing everyone's opinions about it.

Tonight is the first weekly Geek Gaming Night! Excellent! Urn emailed all his geeks and we're all meeting at an unnamed location, where we will proceed to beat the tar out of one another and then go home and consider joining secret terrorist organizations... oh wait, that's Fight Club... We'll be playing Quake (and Half Life and Tribes and others).
