Hee, hee. Best. Fan mail. ever. Must gloat!

Also, I had one of those Horrible Revelations I live for: Isometric only has one kind of joke. It's simple exaggeration, blowing things up to giant size.

For example, take the idea of bread. Make an Isometric. The giant sentient yeast that took over the world!! OH GOD THE BREAD IS OUT OF CONTROL SAVE US JESUS!! IT IS YOUR OWN FAULT MORTALS FOR FORGETTING THE WAYS OF THE UNLEAVENED. etc.

It's dead simple, almost mechanical. I also reverse it sometimes, shrink things down. Take the idea of Godzilla. OH NO GODZILLA IS ATTACKING! What, again? This always happens when you leave the lid of the Giant Reptile Treats! Hey, don't get on my case when you can't even pick up your socks off the floor! Why, you! Are you calling me a slob, when you— etc.
