_No time to say hello, goodbye! I'm late, I'm late, I'm late!_

Yesterday was a much better day than Monday. I was cranky all day Monday, but I managed to shake that off yesterday. I got lots of happy birthday phone calls, and all day long I was looking forward to going out for fried chicken at the Delta Cafe with KT for dinner.

Sometime around lunch, I got a runny nose. I took some claratin and hoped it would clear up, but it only got worse.

Finally, around 4pm, after realizing I had been sitting in front of my computer in a fog for a half-hour and had only succeeded in typing one line of code, I called my boss and told him I was taking the rest of the afternoon off because I was sick.

I still don't know if it was a cold or just allergies, but I think it was allergies, because I didn't have any other symptoms, and I didn't feel sick, and Annie said the allergens were really high yesterday. Today seems to be a little better, which is good.

I finally just lay down and took a nap until KT showed up at 6:30, at which point I felt better, so the three of us headed over to the cafe, where Zach met us for dinner, and a good time was had by all.

The food was awesome.

After dinner I went home and just sat in front of the TV in a haze for awhile (my allergies were back), though I did enjoy the slice of birthday cake Annie got me - she went back to the caterers from our wedding and got me a slice of my wedding cake - the one with a layer of cheesecake topped with a layer of devils-food cake.

Mmmmmmmmmm

Anyways, today I feel better, but I also feel like I have a ton to do between work and website stuff that I was planning on taking care of over the last week. Hopefully I'll be able to get some stuff done today.
