I felt alright on Wednesday. Good enough to go out to Thai food with Eric and Jill, even. I remember mentioning to Eric that I thought I might be coming down with something, because the back of my throat was a bit scratchy. At the time, I could still breath easily and taste the delicious Sukhothai Delight.

But when I woke up on Thursday morning at 6am, I quickly realized I was not going to be able to work. The symptoms weren't too severe, just standard head-cold clogged-nose kind of stuff. But my head was full of cotton. I couldn't focus on anything. I barely managed to call my boss and leave a phone message something like this:

"Hi, this is Scott, It's 6am and I just woke up feeling like hell, so I'm going to be taking a sick day... So... yeah."

Yes, that's how I ended the call. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I remember kicking myself as I fell back into bed - Could I possibly leave a more fake-sounding sick-day message?

The phone rang a couple of times, but I barely moved again until noon, when Sean showed up for lunch. By the time he left, I had hauled my lame ass out of bed and parked it in front of the TV, where I stayed for the rest of the day, watching reruns of Star Trek and some movie about Robert Redford as a prison warden. I even plugged the xbox back in, but never quite managed to turn it on, which should be some indicator of how out of it I was.

I felt a little better by the time the presidential debate came on, which was good, because there were some brilliant moments. I already posted my favorite quote, but my favorite overall moment had to be where Kerry accused Bush of forgetting that the war on terror was about Osama Bin-Ladin, and Bush said "Of course I know the war on terror is about Saddam, I mean Osama!" Sure, it was just a slip of the tongue, but it couldn't have been more perfectly timed. I'm sure some Bush people were backstage beating their heads against their clipboards.

Today I felt enough better to work, though of course I spent the whole day catching up and taking care of minor stuff that had piled up from the day before. I don't want to get into it, but it was all really frustrating, and I'm sure my patience was lower than usual due to the lingering stuffy nose, and having to work twice as hard to enunciate everything on the phone.

I also stumbled across [The Best of Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/), which was a wonderful way to kill my lunch break.

Anyways, I'm feeling a bit better now, and I'm planning on working on some web design and photo-posting this weekend.
