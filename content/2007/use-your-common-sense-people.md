A coworker of mine recently sent me a link and said "[Cool, I didn't know the Germans had a walking tank!](http://surbrook.devermore.net/original/vehicles/mobilefortress.html)"

After a few seconds of conversation, it became clear that he was serious. To his credit, [Kottke linked to this](http://www.kottke.org/remainder/07/11/14539.html), and the stuff he posts is usually trustworthy. I'm not sure if Kottke was also fooled, or if his post is meant to be tongue-in-cheek.

Not to pick on my coworker (or Kottke), but use your common sense, people. Just ask yourself what are the odds that A) Nazi Germany built a 40 foot tall walking tank, and B) 30 years later George Lucas put an exact duplicate of a Nazi war machine into Star Wars, or that C) the only web site mentioning this incredible feat of engineering lists its statistics for a table-top role-playing game?
