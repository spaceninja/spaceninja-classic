> "I suppose we could say that the two games are equally fun, and that there's room in this world for both, but FUCK THAT. History needs to know which is best, so I'm going to award victory who whichever game's developer sends me the best picture of the other game's main character wearing a woman's bra." \-- Zero Punctuation, comparing [Infamous and Prototype](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/789-Prototype)
