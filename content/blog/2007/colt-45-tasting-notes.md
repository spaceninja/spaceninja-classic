> Notes of desperation, with a strong alcohol nose. Pours clear straw yellow with thin white head and fine lacing. I also poured a little out for your b-day. Some adjuncts detected, probably corn, rice or both. Clear glass provoked a strong skunked taste. Definitely light-struck. Some European noble hops detected, possibly Halletauer or its domestic counterpart. A strong American-style pilsener. Works every time.
