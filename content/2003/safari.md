WARNING - Geek Post

So, now that I'm using my mac on a daily basis, I've been using Safari, Apple's web browser, and I have to admit that while I'm probably 98% happy with it, I'm also seriously irritated by a couple of irritating glitches.

1. Occasionally on submitting a form, if I use the back button in the browser, rather than returning me to the form, it just reloads the results - but the browser \*thinks\* it's back on the form, because if you hit back again, it takes you to the previous page.

2. When I load up any KMorg journal with the default skin applied (eg, \[http://forum.killingmachines.org/\], it displays the entire name (minus the first letter) twice, so instead of saying "Forum" at the top, it says "Forumorum" - This bug is CSS related, because I'm using CSS to capitalize the first letter of the word, and it doesn't happen in any other mac browsers.

3. (and perhaps most irritating, since I spend all day working on web forms), If I tab through a form to fill it out, the tab order \*skips\* drop down menus, as if they were not valid form elements. This one really bugs, because I'm used to being able to quickly tab through a form with my keyboard and fill it out without touching the mouse... Now whenever a drop-down menu is a required field, I have to use the mouse to go fill it in.

None of these are really bad errors, and I know that it's a new browser, but it just drives me nuts.

I can't use Chimera/Camino because it doesn't open tab groups correctly (it appears to have a limit, which Safari doesn't have), I can't use IE because it sucks (mainly in that it doesn't have tabbed browsing or popup blocking), and I can't use Mozilla because I'm already using it for mail, and OS X gives you no way to tab between open windows inside a program.

There, now I feel a little better. Overall, I love my mac, and I'm very happy with the switch, but little things like this, that worked perfectly on the PC are driving me nuts.
