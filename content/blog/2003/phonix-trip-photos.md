My trip to Phoenix was great! Business-wise, we had two [meetings](/images/phoenix/kent-lynn-brian.jpg), one [full-day meeting](/images/phoenix/meeting02.jpg) on [Friday](/images/phoenix/meeting03.jpg), and one half-day meeting on [Saturday](/images/phoenix/meeting05.jpg). It was great to finally meet everyone [face-to-face](/images/phoenix/dave-mogenns.jpg), and we really got [a lot of details](/images/phoenix/myview.jpg) sorted out about the new product we're [developing](/images/phoenix/peptalk.jpg).

The hotel we stayed in was amazing. It's called the [Wyndam Buttes](/images/phoenix/skylight.jpg), and it has an amazing view of the city, which really shows [how flat Phoenix is](/images/phoenix/panorama.jpg). The thing I was most impressed with was how they had built the entire hotel to be multi-layered, up the side of the [hill](/images/phoenix/mountain.jpg) (one of about 2 [hills](/images/phoenix/hill.jpg) in all of Phoenix). As a result, instead of [one big pool](/images/phoenix/pool.jpg) and a couple of jacuzzis, they had two big pools, connected together, with stairs going uphill to the two jacuzzis, and a [water slide](/images/phoenix/waterslide.jpg) descending a level to a smaller pool, which was right outside [my](/images/phoenix/room01.jpg) [room](/images/phoenix/room02.jpg). The "ground floor" where we entered the hotel, was actually the fifth floor, and you accessed the lower levels via elevators across a [skybridge](/images/phoenix/skybridge.jpg). Even the [lobby](/images/phoenix/lobby.jpg) was designed to look like the outer [desert](/images/phoenix/cactus.jpg), complete with a [waterfall](/images/phoenix/waterfall.jpg), emptying into a [coy pond](/images/phoenix/waterfallcoy.jpg) in the restaurant downstairs, which flowed [outside](/images/phoenix/poolfall.jpg) down another waterfall emptying into the pool.

Our first night there, we had an (expensive!) dinner at the "[Top Of The Rock](/images/phoenix/topofrock.jpg)" restaurant, where I got a nice [view](/images/phoenix/topofrockview.jpg) of the [sunset](/images/phoenix/sunset01.jpg) over [downtown](/images/phoenix/sunset02.jpg).

After I got home, I had a nice birthday. Just about everyone came over, and we drank White Russians and watched _[Scratch](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0143861)_, a documentary about hip-hop and turntablism. Eric gave me an awesome [bottle of vodka](http://www.redarmyvodka.com/home.htm), and the next day, a bunch of us went to [ElectroFish](http://www.dailypdx.com/bar/bar.02.07.03.shtml), a local sushi bar that plays downtempo music.
