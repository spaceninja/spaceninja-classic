According to Leapfish, [Spaceninja.com is worth nearly $45,000](http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=spaceninja.com). Not bad for a domain I bought in college with a buddy by combining two words we liked (our first attempt was Spacemonkey.com, because Fight Club had just come out, but it was taken).

To contrast, Leapfish values [Google.com at $2.8 Million](http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=google.com) - with a footnote that the domain is probably more valuable than their tool can calculate - and [Wordpress.org at $314,000](http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=wordpress.org).
