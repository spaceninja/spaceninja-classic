We saw Eddie Izzard live last night, and it was awesome. His new set, Stripped, is very similar to Dress to Kill in that it's mostly jokes about history and religion. He discusses the controversy about Intelligent Design vs Evolution (including Charles Darwin's famous book Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, You) and the improbability of Noah's Ark. The tour is nearly over, but this is definitely one to pick up when it comes out on DVD.
