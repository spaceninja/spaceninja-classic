I knew I forgot something last night! Annie and I are getting a car! It's a complicated story, but what it boils down to is that Annie's grandmother bought a Subaru in the 90s, and it got in a wreck, and due to complications, she just bought a new car, and this Subaru isn't being used by anyone. So Annie's parents have agreed to split the cost of buying it with us, so we're getting a 1990 (or 93) Subaru Legacy for around $1000.

We couldn't be more excited, since this is perfect timing. We knew we were going to have to buy a car soon, since we're moving north, and also Annie is starting to nanny soon, and the nanny agency requires that you have a car available.

I've been trying to look up photos, but these may or may not be representative of the car, since we aren't sure what year or model it is - it's either a 1990 or a 1993, and it's either an Outback or a Legacy. If I'm reading these sites right, though, Subaru didn't make the Outback in the early 90s, it's probably a Legacy, and there's not a huge difference in body styles between the 90 and the 93.

So go ahead and check [these](http://www.diamondlot.com/cgi/info.exe?bc=938478&dealer=CHAPAG) [photos](http://www.diamondlot.com/cgi/info.exe?bc=1061653&dealer=TOYPUYA) out - ours is in green.

Oh, and before anyone asks - Yes, I'll be getting my license soon, now that I'll have a car readily available to practice in.
