Agh! Has this horrid design really been up for two weeks? I thought if I put up an ugly design it would motivate me to finish the code changes and start work on a better design, but instead I've barely been posting at all - I think a change in strategy is needed.

I've got a lot of other web design work to do at work today, so I'm hoping I can finish that up and just flow right on into working on my own site. There's only a couple of hours of template tweaking needed before the whole site is configured properly, but I may instead jump right to the redesign and tweak templates afterwards, since the front page is done being tweaked, so I can build on it.

Anyways, lots of stuff happening lately. In the computer world, my copy of Doom 3 arrived, and even on my old video card, it rocks. My new video card (if I ever get it working) should blow me out of the water. Sadly, I'm leaving town for a week on Sunday (more on that in a minute), so I won't be playing much, but when I get back it will only be two weeks until Half Life 2 is here!

In the work world, things have been alternating between crazy busy and crazy stressful. There have been points in the last few weeks where I was absolutely miserable and ready to kill my boss and all my coworkers, and there have been other days when things seem almost under control. The reason for all the chaos is that four of us are flying to Indianapolis on Sunday for Gen Con, which always brings a ton of work, no matter how prepared we are. Still, we think we've gotten all our ducks in a row this year, and things may go smoothly. I'll be bringing my camera and posting photos into my new photoblog all week long (assuming I get that finished before I leave).

In the "real" world, Annie and I just got back from our four-day anniversary weekend trip with Urn and Kat and Dave and Rose. We stayed at a hostel in Port Angeles called "Thor Town," and saw some of the sights and had a lot of fun and also all got on each other's nerves. Lesson learned: Everyone needs separate rooms, and board games don't mix with staying up late and drinking three bottles of wine. Still, we had a lot of fun, and hopefully next year we'll do it again, possibly in a more exciting local. I'll try to post a longer post about our trip later.

Finally, there's been drama drama drama everywhere and of every type. I don't want to get into the details, but the reason I mention it is that all of the drama seems to be making progress, and things seem to be slowly but surely getting better on all fronts.

Last night I rented _Saving Private Ryan_ and ate a cheap frozen pizza from Plaid Pantry. You wouldn't think that horrific battle scenes with lots of carnage would go well with pepperoni, but it turned out alright, and the movie was really good. This weekend I'm also going to watch _Road To Perdition_, which doesn't look that interesting, but it's based on the manga _Lone Wolf and Cub_, which is incredible, so I'm going to give it a chance. Also, _The Terminal_ is showing at the Laurelhurst. It's a Tom Hanks blow-out!
