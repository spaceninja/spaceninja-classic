[![Macintosh iBook](/images/ibook.jpg "Macintosh iBook")](http://www.apple.com/ibook/)

Guess what I just bought?

(I got the one with the 12 inch screen, and the 900MHz G3 processor, 128MB RAM with the combo CD-RW/DVD drive.)

It'll be here in about a week!

**Decision Factors:**

- low price on iBooks
- OSX is a sweet operating system
- it's about time to replace my current PC
- aside from gaming, I have no particular reason to stick with windows
- mac hardware is generally more reliable than PC
- Apple has a decent loan program that will let me pay in installments, and pay the whole thing off anytime I have the money with no penalties
- laptop will let me take my primary computer with me when I go places (which I'm doing more of lately)
- look how shiny!

On a side note, if anyone is interested in purchasing my existing PC, I'd be willing to part with it for less that $500. If you're interested, give me a call. It's an Athlon 700MHz with 512MB RAM.
