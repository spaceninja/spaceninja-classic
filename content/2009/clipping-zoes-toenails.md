Since Zoe was very little, it's been my job to clip her nails. The funny thing is, you would expect a small child to resist this, but Zoe has always been fascinated with the whole process. She sits calmly in my lap, and holds out her hands and feet. Once she got big enough, we had to strike a deal where she gets to carry around the clippers for a few minutes once I'm done. I'm not sure what the appeal is for her, other than OOH SHINY, but I'm glad she lets me do it.
