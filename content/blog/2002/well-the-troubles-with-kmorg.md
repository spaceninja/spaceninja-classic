well, the troubles with kmorg seem to have cleared up as mysteriously as they appeared.

some days ago, kmorg stopped working and the logs started producing some bizarre messages i hadn't seen before. nothing was wrong with the zone file, though. in fact, nothing had changed. strange.

this morning, the log files were producing another error message i hadn't seen before, but that indicated the problem was reparable. there was a subdomain with some disallowed characters - deleted the subdomain, suddenly it started working again.

but...what had happened last week that was different?
