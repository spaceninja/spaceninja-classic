I made the mistake of reviewing both [Fallout 3](/2008/10/fallout-3-first-impressions/) and [Gears of War 2](/2008/12/gears-of-war-2-one-paragraph-review/) before I had finished them. I tend to play pretty slowly, and I was afraid that if I waited until I beat the games, then the reviews would be pointless. So I played both games for a few hours, and then threw up my first impressions, and in both cases, my first impression of the game was misleading.

In the case of Fallout, I said that the game was clever, and perfectly captured the feel of the original. I stand by the fact that the game is clever -- at one point, you have to rescue your dad from a virtual reality he's been trapped in -- and the scope is quite ambitious. But honestly, the graphics really started bugging me.

Everything in the world, literally _everything_ is the same dull gray-brown color. Everything is dusty and dirty and rusty and falling apart. Even when you get to the last bastions of civilization, the color scheme only shifts from dirty gray-brown to clean gunmetal-gray. Frankly, it's depressing. I get that they're modeling their future on the photos of Hiroshima after the bomb, with all the wrecked buildings. But this is set _200 years_ after the bomb! You need look no further than Chernobyl to see that even radiation-savaged land is eventually reclaimed by nature. And when you combine the never ending monochromatic scenery with the Oblivion engine's soulless faces peering out of the uncanny valley, you end up with a game world that I really wanted to love, but couldn't quite get into.

I didn't realize how much this bothered me until I started playing Fable 2, with its colorful scenery and its stylized characters. I'll talk more about this when I review Fable soon, because while the contrast between these games couldn't be more dramatic, there's several key points where they overlap, and in every one of them, Fable comes out on top.

And as for Gears, I said that it was good, but basically just more of the same. However, just a bit further than I had progressed when I wrote that, the game gets absolutely crazy. While the gameplay is nothing different, and there were a few points where I got frustrated, the sheer scale and insanity of the boss fights more than redeems the game. Plus, I hate to say it, but as thin as the plot normally is, they managed to drop a pretty interesting twist towards the end that has me looking forward to the next installment.
