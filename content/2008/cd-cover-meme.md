[![Sir! No Sir! - cd cover meme](/images/2234228858_eea9647491.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2234228858/)

I normally avoid memes like the plague (notice how every post about a meme starts this way?) but when [Sara posted her entry for the CD cover meme](http://sararyan.com/2008/01/cd-cover-meme/), I had to participate. The rules are simple:

1. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) The title of the article is the name of your band.
2. [http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3](http://www.quotationspage.com/random.php3) The last four words of the very last quote is the title of your album.
3. [http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/](http://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/7days/) The third picture, no matter what it is, will be your album cover. (make sure you choose a creative-commons one!)

My wikipedia article was [Sir! No Sir!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir%21_No_Sir%21), my photo was [a cat photo by Zenera](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenera/2219360536/), and my quote was by [Martin Luther King Jr.](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/429.html): "Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have **guided missiles and misguided men**." (Yes, okay, technically I used _five_ words from the quote, but I don't think "and" should count, the quote is much better this way, and besides, what fun is a meme if you can't bend the rules?
