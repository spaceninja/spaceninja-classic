Frequently, my coworkers will forget their Bugzilla passwords. They come to me, because I manage it, and I always send them to the reset password page. Inevitably, they come back a few minutes later and tell me that it didn't work, and I just reset their passwords by hand. Well, I finally figured out the problem. Take a look at this screenshot and see if you can spot the problem. Remember that they've gotten to this page by clicking on a link that says "Reset Your Password."

In case it's not obvious, here's a screenshot with the reset password form highlighted:

Yes, that's right, when you click on "Reset Your Password," you're taken to a page where the first and clearest call to action is a login form! Hidden beneath it is the actual form, but no one ever sees it. Seriously, Bugzilla, I love you guys, but hire a UI designer, please.
