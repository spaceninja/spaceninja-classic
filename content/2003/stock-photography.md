Okay, I know there probably aren't a whole lot of graphic designers reading this site, but if you or anyone you know are looking for stock photography for a design project, you know that it's expensive. So do yourself a favor and check out [iStockPhoto.com](http://www.istockphoto.com/). I found this site through [Zeldman.com](http://www.zeldman.com/), who has some connection to the site.  
  
Basically, it's just like any stock photography site on the internet. You get an account, and then pay to download images, which you can use in commercial projects. The advantage of this site is that they use a system of "micropayments", where you pay only 50 cents for a download, and all the photos are royalty-free (meaning you can use them without having to pay a royalty fee to the photographer). This is a pretty phenomenally low price. The only catch that I've found so far is that if you use the photo in a way that it will be reproduces more that 500,000 times, you have to pay a small royalty fee... but for my purposes, that's nothing I'll ever run into.  
  
Definitely worth checking out if you have any need for stock photography.
