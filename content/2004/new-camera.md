My new camera arrived early this weekend, so I was able to goof around with it. You can see a few of the first photos that got taken below.

On Saturday, Dave and Rose drove down so that Rose could go shopping with Annie, and so that Dave could eat sushi with me. We went to Todai and stuffed ourselves, and it was great. Then we spent the rest of the day playing Dead or Alive with Miles and Sean.

On Sunday, Annie and I went grocery shopping, and ran into Xima at the store, who told us that her and Eric were thinking of going to see _Delicatessen_ at the Laurelhurst. Turns out that movie is by the same guy who did _City of Lost Children_ and _Amelie_, so we agreed to see it with them and Miles. It was great. The same odd sense of fantasy and strange imagery as the other two, but with this weird post-apocolyptic setting. It was very good.
