So, despite my best intentions to focus on web design this week, various real-life projects have butted in and demanded that I focus on them first. I'm about to plow back into my portfolio redesign, but here's a quick list of some of the stuff we've done in the last couple of days.

- Decorating: We **finally** got around to decorating our home, now that we've been here for three months. (to be fair, it was the holidays during that time, so we had temporary decorations up). Now we've got our prints and maps hung up on the walls, as well as all my Obey Giant posters back up in the office (which looks awesome). Photos coming soon.
- Ikea Assembly: We bought two shelves and two dressers from Ikea, and I assembled them and mounted them. The shelves took some work, because either our apartment has oddly-spaced studs or (more likely) the Swedes use a different standard. Either way, the mounting bracket for the shelves didn't line up with our studs, so I had to learn about the wonders of drywall anchors, and a got an impressive box of giant drill-like ones that work like a charm. The dressers were a pain in the ass to assemble, but now that they're together, they look great, and I absolutely love having drawers on casters instead of just wood grinding on wood.
- Cleaning: Obviously, the previous two projects created quite a mess, which we're still digging our way out from under. Once it's done, I'll take some photos and post them.
