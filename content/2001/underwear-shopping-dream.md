I just remembered part of my freaky dreams last night. I was buying new boxers, and appearently I had been sized for them, because the saleswoman came out and said in snide voice "Sir, you wear size \*50\* underwear." I was shocked, as that seemed rather large, and began protesting, and she went on to add that "perhaps you shouldn't shop in the KID'S department." I looked around, and suddenly realized I was shopping in the young boy's department! Horrified, I ran from the store, at which point the dream shifted to a fight scene between me (and my "gang" consisting of steve and some people I knew in high school) and some gutter punks, who attacked us with umbrellas.
