So my boss asks me to call one of our clients, who can't get into the admin area for their software. This is a client I've been dealing with for a little while now. She's nice and easy-going, and and we basically created a program from scratch for her, built to her specifications.

I call her up, and manage to get the bug fixed (bad password). While that's going on, she get another guy on the phone, and they start casually asking questions about certain features. Over the next few minutes, two more guys get on the phone, and I suddenly realize that I've been ambushed. They're asking very pointed questions about features that the product doesn't have because they didn't ask for them, and they're chewing me out for it.

I was so startled by this turn of events that I reverted to my standard customer damage-control practices, which may have made things worse, because I was apologizing for something we did RIGHT! They were angry because the product doesn't have features they specifically told us they didn't need!

Net Result: I gave them my boss's number because I'm not authorized to make decisions like this, and now I'm sitting here all frazzled because a customer decided to chew me out for doing exactly what they told me to do.
