I have the heaters in our house set to maintain a temperature around 70 degrees. This morning, I woke up to find the house is 60 degrees, and all the heaters are still on. I think we may have reached the point where our heaters aren't putting out enough heat to counter-balance the heat we're losing to the cold outside.
