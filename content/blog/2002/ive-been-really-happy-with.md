I've been really happy with [Radio Space Ninja](http://radio.spaceninja.com:8000). I've usually got two or three people listening, which is more than I would ever have expected, since it's just streaming what I listen to all day. As a result, I tweaked the playlist a little today. Some of the Dimitri from Paris disco stuff was getting a little repetitive, so I removed some of the duplicates and now I think it's a lot better. It's over 68 hours long, and has just about 800 songs in it. If you're interested, you can see the new playlist [here](http://zip.fojar.com:8080/playlist.html) (It's sorted alphabetically, but I've got it all randomized when I play it).

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Shortly after setting this up, I had to shut down my radio station due to new laws that made it illegal.
