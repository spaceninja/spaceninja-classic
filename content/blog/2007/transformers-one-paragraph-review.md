This movie is absolutely good. Giant robots beat each other up and do acrobatics off buildings. The chase scenes on the freeway are particularly good, as are the establishing scenes where the humans meet Bumblebee for the first time. It's absolutely jam-packed with cheesy references and corny jokes, as it should be. One of my favorite moments is when Bumblebee summons the other Autobots by shining the Autobot logo onto the clouds. So to all the people who are worried about Michael Bay trampling on their childhood memories, let me offer a bit of perspective. If this movie had been made exactly the same, but without the transformers brand applied to it, you would all universally hail it as the greatest robot movie ever made, and wonder why they haven't made a Transformers movie like it. Trust me - you'll enjoy it.
