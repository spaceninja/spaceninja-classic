"my feminist tendencies are being compromised by my need for a pocket" ~Me

aahhh... home at last...I'm seriously considering making my secret room off my closet this enormous girlie room... all shiny things and feathers... heehee! the rest of the house can be gray for all I care... well, except the kitchen, which is ladybugs, sunflowers and strawberries, and my computer room... which Scott can't touch... oh yeah, and the bathroom because who wants to get clean in a gray room? maybe only his computer room gets to be gray 'cause I can't touch it. :)

We measured the rooms last night so he could make a SIMS version of our place...only a true geek is compelled to replicate his current dwellings on a computer screen. so I figured out the square footage and it turns out we have roughly 1,000 sq. ft.! my dad's jealous because that's bigger than our first house! they had three little kids in like 650 sq. ft. ha! I win!

now I'm busying myself with plans for my garden in the spring and composting ideas and safe house cleaning ideas...it's going to be awesome. I'm going to get rid of cleaners I don't need and just use baking soda and vinegar forever! whoohoo! If I can't work outside I 'll clean up the world that is inside!

I hope I don't turn into one of those crazy bored housewives who keep a spotless home and take tranquilizers... but I think I've read too many feminist magazines and books for that fortunately...
