To say that Half-Life 2 improves on the original is like saying that a Harley is an improvement from the red tricycle you had as a child. It is not just an evolution of the game to a higher form, it is a revolution that sets incredibly high standards for any game that tries to follow it.

The first Half-Life was a fantastic game that revitalized first-person shooters, and showed us that we could expect more from the genre. It had great multiplayer and fantastic weapons. It had excellent graphics for the time, and added abilities like crouching and crouch-jumping to the basic movement set we can home to expect from Quake. The best thing Half-Life, however, was that it had a compelling story.

None of the other FPS games at the time had much of a story. The original Doom probably had the most interesting, and that was simply a space marine who fights demons from Hell following some kind of accident. The original Quake managed to trim this story down to a space marine who fights demons for no particular reason. Quake 2 attempted to add a story, about space marines who fight aliens, but the story was not especially engaging, and wasn't even explained in-game.

Half-Life, on the other hand, let you know right off the bat that it was different. The game opened with you inside a subway car on your way to work. Through subway announcements and some sparse on-screen text, you managed to fill in the gaps and conclude that your name was Gordon Freeman, and that you worked as a research scientist at a top-secret government facility called Black Mesa. During the introduction, you were free to wander around the subway car and look at things out the window, but you couldn't do anything other than wait for the story to begin. When the subway car pulled into the station, you were greeted by a guard, and several scientists, who chastise you for being late to work. You proceed to the "test chamber," where things go horribly wrong, and you (as Gordon) proceed to acquire armor and your first weapon, the crowbar, before you ever encounter an enemy.

Throughout the game, the storyline is advanced in a natural manner, and you never once break character, or step outside Gordon's body. Everything is told in first-person perspective, and you gradually uncover a story about what caused the accident, the government's brutal attempts to cover it up, and the alien invasion that results. The story is told so well, and so naturally, that it's easy to forget that this approach was completely revolutionary at the time.

I'm pleased to report that Half-Life 2 continues this fine tradition. While many other FPS games have imitated the Half-Life style, few have achieved the same level of quality, and none have surpassed it.

Once again, you (as Gordon) are dropped into character with no explanation of what's going on. You "wake up" on a train, and arrive in a run-down train station, filled with abuse guards and government propaganda. You have no weapons or armor, and frankly, you don't miss them, as you are bound to spend the first 20 minutes of gameplay just admiring the view. You quickly learn that you are still on Earth, but several years have passed, and the Earth has been conquered by an alien race called the Combine. Many references are made to the original game, and you run into several old friends early on, before you are thrust into the action. Like the first game, the story naturally leads you from scenario to scenario, leaving you with no choice but to proceed as planned, but it all happens so naturally that you don't question this. Events are scripted and planned in the same way as a good novel.

While the story is fantastic, and a worthy successor to the original, the graphics are what really steal the show. The game engine looks nearly photorealistic, and even something as boring as a dingy run-down train station looks breathtakingly real, right down to motes of dust swimming in shafts of sunlight. The star of the graphics engine are the people. Never before has a game engine featured people that look so real. Doom 3, the game's only real competition in the graphics department, had fantastic environmental visuals, but the people all looked like they were wearing rubber masks, especially when speaking. In Half-Life 2, the people look incredibly real when sitting still, and the effect is uncanny when they start speaking. One of the promotional videos mentioned that Valve based a lot of the work they put into facial animation on work done by a research scientist on how muscles in the face interact, and they managed to build an engine that doesn't just cut a hole for a mouth and move the chin up and down for talking - character's faces move realistically, express emotions, and lip-synch to their recorded dialog.

Finally, while the game features several impressive advances in the physics engine, which allows them to accurately simulate not just gravity, but breaking glass, splintering wood, and sloshing water. The promotional video shows how objects can be set to take their physics cue from their textures, so that an object with a wood texture will splinter when shot, float in water, and burn when set on fire - while a metal texture will pling harmlessly when shot, sink in water, and resist flames. None of this is obvious in-game, except for upping the overall level of realism. When you see fire, it behaves in a way you would expect. Wooden objects can be broken apart, and objects in water behave logically.

As far as gameplay, the FPS industry has essentially agreed on a standard set of movement controls and abilities, based on what was originally available in Half-Life, so it's easy to learn how to work with the game world. The improvements made have been to things that you can interact with, such as impressive new weapons like the gravity gun or vehicles like the jet-boat and dune-buggy. As well, the ability to interact with non-player characters has been retained (from the original game's expansion pack) and improved, allowing you control a squad of rebels or direct a pack of ant-lions. These interactions have been extremely streamlined to focus on the first-player element, and keep it from turning into a squad game, but you can tell your team to stay, to follow, or to go over there. Along the way, they will follow their programmed behaviors, which are simplistic, but effective (attack enemies, utilize cover, heal wounded friendlies, etc.).

In face, the only gripe I have is not actually with the game. Valve has decided that online distribution is the future, and developed a program called Steam that lets them sell games to people over the internet, and they can download updates and extra content, as well as verify the game's legality. This is all well and good, except that it requires an internet connection and an account on the Steam network, and if either is unavailable, you cannot play the game. For people like myself, who bought the DVD copy of the game so we could play offline, this was a bit of a shock. Most of the time, it's not a problem, since I have cable internet, but I already experienced problems when I had to set up my Steam account the day that Half-Life 2 was released. Since the servers were overloaded with everyone trying to set up their accounts and get online at once, I was unable to play my copy of the game for several hours, even though I had the legal copy of the DVD sitting in my drive. It would have been nice for Valve to provide an offline option for these situations.

Still, that is my only complaint. As a friend of mine remarked, "Halo 2 was evolutionary, and Half-Life 2 is revolutionary." He was absolutely correct. In every aspect, Half-Life 2 is setting the bar higher for the FPS genre, and it's going to be hard for anyone to compete with this game for quite awhile.
