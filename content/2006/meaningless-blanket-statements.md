> "Despite the excellent guidance of meaningless blanket statements like 'tough on terror' and 'stay the course,' the military has taken it upon themself to adjust to the realities of the modern world. And personally, I'm proud of them." \-- [zefrank](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/10/100506.html), referring to a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/05/washington/05doctrine.html?hp&ex=1160020800&en=e6b7b0a33710f246&ei=5094&partner=homepage)
