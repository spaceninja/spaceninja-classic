I am having an excellent weekend. Last night we drove to Portland for Jackie's wedding, and I played my new partial mix CD. It consists of all the mp3s I've downloaded lately for three separate mix CDs - The _Real Genius_ Soundtrack, my compilation of "Whiskey In The Jar" covers, and Luke Ski fanboy songs.

The wedding was really nice, and then we came home, inflated the bed and went to sleep - and I didn't get up until 2:30 today. It was great. Now we're going to go see _Team America_ at the Laurelhurst and then go to a party at Eric and Jill's house.

The only bad part is that I'm completely addicted to World of Warcraft, and I seriously debated actually bringing my computer down, under the guise of "showing" WoW to Sean. I probably would have let him play. "Oh what's that, Sean? You're not interested in playing? Well, I guess I'll just have to, then..." Luckily, I managed to regain control at the last minute, and left my computer up north, so I'm going to socialize with people like a normal human being this weekend.
