\-or- The Girl Who Made High School Suck

So after I dumped Psycho Alien Chick, I had my hands free to pursue my newer interest. I met her at Outdoor School. We had actually gone to school together for years, but never really spoke. Now, suddenly we got along really well and I asked her out. I remember the day I asked her out, a bunch of idiots were running around the school with raw eggs, breaking them over their friends heads. Why eggs? We had to carry eggs for a week in Health class in the hope that we would anthropomorphize this egg into a human baby. Obviously, looking at the egg on the floor, this failed.

Anyway, she said yes, and we embarked on a relationship that was only slightly healthier than my last one. Granted, this girl wasn't completely freaking insane, but the relationship just wasn't that much better. We almost immediately proclaimed our love for one another (I still hadn't learned my lesson). We never had sex. We fooled around a lot, and it wasn't until after this relationship ended that it dawned on me that everything we did was very one-sided. I won't gross you guys out with details (there are other websites for that), but I was giving a LOT more than I was receiving.

This relationship went on forever. To all of our friends, who were having 1 or 2 month long relationships, we were the perma-couple, outlasted by only one other couple in our group. Everyone said we were great together, and I think we believed it.

We had rough spots, and good spots. I think the good spots outweighed the rough spots. I don't look back on the relationship as bad, just the way it ended. We were faithful to each other, although I do remember both of us getting mad at the other once or twice when we confessed that we liked someone else. We never did anything about it, just admitted that we liked this person. We both flirted with other people a lot, and that seemed to be fine, for the most part.

Halloween. Just before our one-year-anniversary. We both went to a party a mutual friend was throwing. A ways into the party, she breaks down on the couch and starts crying. I can't get her to tell me what's wrong, and she finally decides to go home. I stayed at the party. Awhile later, I met a girl. She was also from outdoor school, and we started swapping camp stories. It was great. We were flirting and really really really hitting it off. As the party wound down, most people went home, and everyone who remained behind was a couple. There was a couple sleeping on one couch, another on a different couch, and two on the floor, including the girl who was throwing the party. Except for maybe some kissing, everyone seemed to go right to sleep.

Everyone except me and the new girl. We were making out like mad. We were both really horny, and it didn't even occur to me to stop her until she tried to take off my pants. Suddenly I remember my girlfriend and told her I couldn't. So we just cuddled up together and slept. The next morning was kinda awkward, and I left a little early. On the walk home, I realized I was fucked. I decided (being the brilliant little guy I was) that the only way to survive was to just not tell my girlfriend, and then everything would be fine. My course of action decided, I headed for home, whistling.

30 hours later. I walk into my photography class, which I have with my girlfriend. As I walk in, three heads swivel around and glare at me. Girlfriend, girl who threw the party, and another mutual friend. My girlfriend is crying. The others are comforting her. I open my mouth to speak, and she yells for me to leave. I leave.

Fuck fuck fuck, I remember thinking to myself. I ran into an old buddy of mine, and remember having a very frank discussion with him. "Wow. You're screwed." was his reaction.

I ran into my girlfriend in the park awhile later. She had calmed down to the point where she felt up to yelling at me for awhile. I wise up a little and let her. We sat down facing each other under some trees and I explain that all we did was make out. This doesn't help at all. After a couple hours of yelling and crying, she goes home. I walk home, past a small group of my friends, who all glare at me.

Over the next several days, I quickly discover who is better friends with her than me. Our little group of friends is torn apart which sucked. This had been happening for a little bit, and there was already a splinter group, who I began to each lunch with. These were the friends who still liked me. They didn't approve of what I did, but they could tolerate my presence. The old group would no longer.

So game over, right? New group of friends, move on with life? Wrong. She and I still have several classes together. In one class, we're lab partners for the year, with no hope of changing it. It's only November. 7 months of this left. We share a locker. One friend offers to share his locker with me. I decline, on the logic that she and I have to learn to get along together or we'll both fail several classes.

The year is hell. She learned to tolerate my presence and we even manage to get work done in our classes, but she hates me still. And so her all of her (formerly our) friends. My new groups quickly adopts me, and a few friends that I wasn't very close with actually became better friends. But the year still sucked ass.

I even hooked up with the girl from the party, but you'll see about that in the next entry.

EPILOGUE: Years later, She and I have gotten to be friends again. We hang out a bit, make out a bit when we're both single, and talk about stuff. One day she confesses the reason she left the party that night.

She was thinking about cheating on me with one of my best friends.
