Last night I saw the most exciting fireworks show ever. They were lighting fireworks off on this dock in the bay. We were standing right at the waterfront, so we had a great view. But that's now why it was the most exciting. It also wasn't because the fireworks were going off really low and were really loud, though they were doing that. It wasn't because they were especially cool fireworks, though they were good. The reason it was the most exciting fireworks show ever was because one of the fireworks landed in the water 15 feet in front of us and blew up. It was the loudest sound I have ever heard. There was no light or fire or anything, so we're not sure what happened, but something landed right in front of use and EXPLODED. It scared everyone, and we all took two big steps back from the railing. After a few minutes, as the fireworks kept going, we all gradually stepped back where we were, lulled into a false sense of security by the continuing fireworks. That's when it happened a SECOND TIME. No more than a foot away from spot where the first one landed, there was another explosion! Luckily, no one was hurt. After that, we noticed a few fireworks went off suspiciously low over the dock that was launching them. It was a great fireworks show (except for the threat of bodily harm), but I can't decide if the guy they had launching them was drunk or just completely inept.
