So as I was going through my email today, trying to reply to messages people sent me several weeks ago, I re-discovered a link in an email Daniel Achterman sent me. Here's what he had to say about it.

> Essentially, a team of 14 designer-programmers got together in a barn in Oakland and spent four days creating 12 games based on a single piece of technology. What was the basis of the IGJ? Well, one day Doug Church (of System Shock 2 and Thief fame) and a few friends got together and tried to figure out how many sprites a computer with the latest hardware could render. The answer is a pretty stunning 100,000. After creating an engine to let them work with hundreds of thousands of sprites (most of them DOOM bitmaps), they met for 4 days and ended up with games like "Angry God Bowling", "Very Serious RoboDOOM", and "Red Rover". Here's a handy link to the IGJ website, including screenshots. No source code yet, but I'm sure it will be up in time:

Decidua Fighter is a game idea that Miles came up with. Unfortunately, I seem to have lost the original email, but the basic idea was some sort of combat game with trees. Over the course of the several weeks we were toying with the idea before shelving it as impractical, the game went through several possible incarnations, including a Street Fighter 2 style game. But the most promising one was going to be an epic RTS game, where you controlled a forest of trees and tried to take over the world from "enemy" forests. Different trees would have different abilities ("Gah! The dreaded Maple Tree "helicopter" attack!!"), and the whole game would take place at tree speed, meaning in the background you could see cities being built at incredible speeds, and occasionally a group of pilgrims would come cut down a section of your forest (game hazards).  
  
I still think it's one of Miles' best ideas, in terms of the fact that it's completely unique and would be a blast to play. And now it looks like the technology might exist to bring his vision to reality!  
  
Thanks for the link, Daniel!
