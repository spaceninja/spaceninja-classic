<!--Greetings, loyal Y5 fans! I want to apologize for the long delay in updates on the site. With the recent events surrounding the band, the future of this website seemed unclear, and it has only been in the last few weeks that Dr. Colossus has contacted me regarding updates. Never fear, however, there's new stuff on nearly every page! We've got updated news, more free stuff, more stuff in the store, updated band information and discographies, and a kick-ass gold-chrome version of the band logo that I just had to post! So wander around and check things out, and don't be afraid to email the band with any questions!-->
