These last couple weeks at work have been oddly stressful. My regular duties have been completely replaced with tech support, which I am skilled at, but don't enjoy at all. When I was working with the programmers, I felt like I was accomplishing something. When I answer phones all day and look up lost passwords and give people FTP instructions over and over again, I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.

Add to that the stress of knowing that my employment is running out, and the recent move, and a whirlwind trip to Portland last weekend, and it makes sense that I've been fighting off a cold ever since we got to Washington.

That cold hit me full force on Sunday night, and I was out of commision for the next 36 hours. I went to bed at 8pm on Sunday night, and got up at 9am Monday morning, after waking up every hour on the hour all night. Luckily, the worst of it passed on Monday, and I felt up to working again on Tuesday. My cold symptoms have been weakening all week, and today I feel mostly human, with a lingering weak cough and slightly runny nose.

With luck, I'll be almost fully recovered in time to fly out to GenCon on Monday. I'm hoping that a week in Anaheim will be just the thing to help me unwind after my last week at work.

On the one hand, it would be nice to get a clean break from this job and be able to move forward more easily, but with no job lined up yet, I'll still be doing odd jobs for my boss for the next several weeks - probably more of the same tech support kind of stuff. It sucks, but any money is better than none right now.

Bleagh. I'm boring myself writing about this. It's uninteresting, but I felt the need to explain why I haven't been around much lately. Between work and my cold, I just haven't been up to doing much of anything in my off hours.
