Even though [Bill Gates thinks this game is for girls](http://kotaku.com/gaming/bill-gates/gates-viva-piata-is-for-girls-234165.php), I enjoy it. Take the best parts of the Sims and Animal Crossing, and throw in a healthy mix of farming, and you've got a rough idea of what Viva Piñata is like. I think what I like best is that this is a game that can be enjoyed regardless of how hardcore an experience you're looking for. If you just want to sit back and watch the grass grow (literally), you can. You also can get all obsessive and micro-manage your way to the cat-show like world of breeding rare piñatas. Another cool feature is the parental co-op mode, where both controllers control a single cursor - something I can see being useful for parents with toddlers who want to play, but don't necessarily have the fine motor control needed for some operations.
