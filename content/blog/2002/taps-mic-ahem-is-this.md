\*taps mic\*

ahem.. is this \*screeee\* yes, it's on.

"An Ode to Turpentine, by Steve Havelka"

When liquor doesn't do the trick,
and I get none from wine,
I reach for something with a punch,
my dear sweet turpentine.

The rich bouquet of pure C10,
admixed with H16,
it abrogates my discontent
and leaves me so serene.

The morning after's never fun;
You sober folk may scoff.
For turpentine's a precious gift
but you can't sleep it off.
