Can anyone recommend a good local bank, or a bank that has offices in the area? I'm about to be rolling in dough (well, tip-toeing through dough, at any rate) and I'm hoping for:

> \* Low/No monthly charge \* Low/No minimum deposit to establish an account \* Free checking

Or some combination thereof...
