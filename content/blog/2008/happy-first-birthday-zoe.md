Zoe is one year old today! It's hard to believe, I know. Here's a photo I took this morning of her waving at me, and you can see all four of her teeth. And in case you feel like revisiting the event, here's a link to [Annie's birth story](/blog/2007/zoes-birth-story/) and [my birth story](/blog/2007/what-it-was-like-for-me/).
