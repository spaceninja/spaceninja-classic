lookat me! updated!  
  
hey all, just a quick band update: my band is playing this saturday at burlingame pizza, _**on 1st and ash in downtown portland**_, and next saturday at SE 6th and stark (name as yet unknown.)  
  
seeyas! :)  
  
  
the other cool thing is, i completed the deal and signed on to be an dedicated independent contractor to monsoon! i now have a stable and substantial source of income. dinner and drinks are on me. well... no, not really ;)  
  
still, let's celebrate! anyone want to join me at the jazz session sunday evening?
