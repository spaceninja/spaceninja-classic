GOOD NEWS! Both computers are now fully functional again! After trying what tech support suggested for Annie's video card (it didn't work), I was telling Urn about what happened. When he heard that the computer appeared to be fully functional, just not sending anything to the monitor, he asked why didn't I try doing it blind? All I had to do was run a flash utility from a DOS prompt, so it should be easy, as long as I know exactly what to type when. So I booted up the computer with a DOS disk, ran the program, and I didn't think it worked, because the monitor didn't turn on. But when I rebooted, to check, the monitor came on! Everything works again! I even got excited and checked my network settings and discovered that the reason my computers couldn't see anything on the network was because I had them in workgroup "VALHALLA," and they won't work in anything but workgroup "WORKGROUP." Stupid windows. "Here's a neat way to customize your computer, but don't try to use it! It won't work!"

Anyway, I'm happy, and everything works except the stuff that hasn't worked the whole time.

Also, I downloaded a couple of alternate shells that I'm checking out. [Cloud9ine](http://www.cloud9ine.com/), a relatively new shell, and [litestep](http://www.litestep.net/), and old favorite, which seems less buggy than last time I goofed around with it.

I'm going to do a restore from backup in a few minutes to get some of my graphics back, so I can do [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) again, and keep working on my redesign for Studio Fojar.
