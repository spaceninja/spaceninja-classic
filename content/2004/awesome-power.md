I am exploring the flexibility and extensibility of Movable Type, and I'm loving it. There is a very active development community, and you can find a plugin for just about anything you can think of that you might want to do to alter your stock installation, all without having to hack any source code.

Over the next week or so, I'm hoping to get my customizations all nailed down so that Rusted is operating exactly the way I want it. It's pretty close now, but there's a few interface tweaks I want to do. Then I'll be working on cleaning up the HTML and CSS so the site can acheive the zen-like state of full XHTML/CSS compliance.

Also, it will still be skinnable, and I'm working out some new skin ideas in my head, as well as ways to salvage a few old favorites.
