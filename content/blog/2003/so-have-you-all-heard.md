so.. have you all heard of this music festival, "lollapalooza"? it's apparently quite big. apparently, quite the thing. i was looking at their webpage a few minutes ago, and they have all manner of big name acts (even people i've heard of! so they must be popular.)

anyways, i found out at rehearsal tonight that there's a good chance my band will be playing one of the side stages in the seattle and one of the california shows! tee hee, steve goes on tour. :)
