<P>9.10.99
<BR>Well, I haven't made an entry in two months. That's a bit too long for an update, I think. Hmmm... what's been going on with me... Annie and I are still getting along great, and life in our apartment is awesome. We've finally gotten over the debt that accompanies a move, and have gotten to a point where we can start splitting the bills equally and still have some spending money leftover at the end of the month. We had enough money this month that I finally hooked up cable. I'm so sick of bad reception, but there's really not much you can do living in a concrete box. The cable company hooked us up with digital cable. The cable box has a modem built-in to contact the company (not sure why it would have to do that... maybe they're keeping track of what we watch?). The first month we get everything free, so I've been having a blast flipping through all 500 channels (still nothing on, though). It'll be nice when X-Files starts and I can actually read the little readout that says where they are.

<P>I got hired for the job on the tek team! Not sure if I mentioned that before or not. The job is awesome. They started us out doing grunt labor, but we quickly graduated to real jobs, and I'm enjoying myself. I've got cool coworkers, and a good boss. We do work in a concrete bunker underground, but it's kinda cool... there's no sunlight at all (no windows), so I'm going to buy some posters to hang up in here... a few Star Wars posters, and maybe a good looking nature shot. Speaking of posters, we finally broke down and bought some sticky tabs to hang up posters in our apartment. Nothing would stick to the walls, but I really didn't want to get these tabs, since they hardly ever come off posters cleanly. But now they stay up, and I think it's worth it.

<P>We went to the beach for labor day, and it was awesome. Good group of people. KT and Annie, with myself, Jester and Miles. Jester and Miles, we just discovered recently KNOW each other! I was talking to Miles one day, and he mentions juggling... "yeah the little brother of one of my friends in high school was a really good juggler. He ended up at Princeton... probably on a juggling scholarship." A little commotion followed, and we discovered that Jester and Daniel were the same person. A brief email later and Jester knew about it. I had already invited Jester to the beach, so I invited Miles too, and it was cool! We all got along great, and spent the whole weekend babbling about computer games to each other (much to the women's disgust). The weather on the first day was gorgeous, and we spent a good chunk of time on the beach. The next day was horrible and rainy, so we went to the cheese factory, but it lightened up enough for us to have our bonfire and s'mores, and then naturally the day we left was beautiful. Still, a great weekend. We enjoyed ourselves.

<P>I'm not sure where the summer went. I had so much planned to get done this summer, and I got hardly anything done. I've been working really hard, but I haven't read the books I wanted, or beaten my computer games or anything. *sigh* oh well. Maybe next year.

<P>I've been reading Whitley Strieber books lately. He's the guy who wrote <I>Communion</I>, the creepy book about a guy who discovers that he's been visted by what would appear to be aliens ever since he was two. I got the book at a yard sale for a buck, and ended up buying the next three books. They're fascinating reading. I don't think I really believe it, but it succeeds in creeping me out whenever I read them.

<P>Okay I think that's enough for now. I'll try to write more frequently!
