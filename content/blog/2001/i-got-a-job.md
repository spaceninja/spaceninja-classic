Good News! I got a job! Steve's boss at webcoach.com has hired me on part-time as a web designer/assistant to Steve. I'm only working 10-15 hours a week right now, and technically, it's only for 1-2 months, but the boss thinks there's a good chance that he will get more sales and be able to bring me on full-time. I'm looking into other part-time jobs to supplement this, but I'm hoping it will work out to do this. I spend a great deal of my spare time working on websites with Steve, so why not get paid for it? Thanks again, Steve, for recommending me and sticking up for me!
