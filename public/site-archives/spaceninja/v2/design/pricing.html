         <BR>Space Ninja believes that excellent site design should be affordable. We strive to keep our rates set at a reasonable level that allows us to produce a quality site, but does not gouge you for every cent you have.

         <P>PERSONAL SITE DESIGN - $100 one time fee
         <BR>BUSINESS SITE DESIGN - $40 per hour
         <BR>To design your site, Space Ninja will charge you a one-time fee of $100, or an hourly rate of $40/hour for businesses. This fee includes all HTML formatting, image creation and advanced coding needed to produce an average-sized site. For larger sites, a fee will be negotiated. This price does not include hosting or email. You must provide your own place to host the site, though Space Ninja will work with you to find space on one of the major free site hosters (i.e., Geocities, Xoom, etc.).

         <P>CODING - $40 per hour
         <br>Coding includes, but is not limited to, PHP, Perl, JavaScript and MySQL. Space Ninja can develop CGI applications in several languages, for the hourly rate of $40 per hour. This fee includes initial code creation and support.

         <p>MACINTOSH PROGRAMMING - $30 per hour
         <br>Space Ninja can develop applications for the Macintosh Operating System using MetroWerks CodeWarrior. Frameworks used are both MetroWerks PowerPlant and MacZoop (MacZoop is a lightweight, open-source object framework for smaller programs). Applications developed should be of small to medium size. For larger size programs, a price will be negotiated. Programs will be compatible with OS7.5.5 through OSX.
