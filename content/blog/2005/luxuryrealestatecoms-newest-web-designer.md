I was offered a job with [LuxuryRealEstate.com](http://www.luxuryrealestate.com/) today! I responded to an ad on CraigsList, and they had me come in for an interview on Friday. Then today they called to see what my salary requirements were, and offered me the job!

The company is based in Seattle, and I'll be able to catch the Sounder (commuter train) into downtown, and then hop a bus over to the office. They have an in-house design crew that works on their site and also designs sites for other real estate companies. I'll be making about the same as I made at my last job, but with full benefits.

It will be interesting making the transition back from working at home in jeans and a t-shirt to working in an office in "casual dress." I'm actually looking forward to it, as working in an office really helps with the motivational and distraction challenges that you face working from home.

I start in a week on Tuesday, so it looks like I'll be spending the rest of this week doing as much personal web design as possible to clear out my to-do list before I start doing this for a living again.

So, yeah... Hooray!
