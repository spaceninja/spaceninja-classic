So the may party was a success! Everyone we invited showed up, with the exception of Daniel and Becky (Daniel is hard at work preparing for E3 in the coming week) and Gwyn (who is travelling this week). There was much drinking, and laughing, and talking, and honestly I'm still a bit drunk right now. I'm waiting for Annie and Rose to finish up in the bathroom. I'm probably in for a wait, since they're probably discussing pregnancy, but I figured I'd use the opportunity to post to my website and talk about how awesome the party was. Tomorrow, when I'm a little more sober, I'll get photos from Urn and maybe post KT's invitation as well. Enjoy the quote I already posted from Noah...
