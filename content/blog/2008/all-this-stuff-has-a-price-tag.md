> "In truth, however, I know there are lots of Americans who, whatever their income, believe that the government should get its grubby hands off their money. To them, I'd simply say that if you drive on a highway, walk on a sidewalk, use the postal service, send your kids to public school (or appreciate the fact that public schools keep your neighbors' kids off the streets), and generally enjoy the fact that 300 million people are able to live in something other than chaos and squalor, you should accept the fact that all this stuff has a price tag."
