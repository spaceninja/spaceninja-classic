Continuing what Scott was saying below about restoring websites, I wanted to update interested parties on the status of my own webpages:

Scott's restored [Leilani's Webpage](http://leilani.spaceninja.com) to it's former status, somewhere on his new hosting. He's working on an installation of Movable Type that will allow us to set up a photoblog, which we (me, scott, my parents, sean, etc) will all be able to post to, now that she's in town and everyone can take pictures. I will also be reworking and updating the gallery page, the timeline, and a few other surprises. I am also going to register a domain name for it, which I will post here once it's set up.

My first web address, and first webpage, are still fully functional at [http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/6534](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/6534) or [http://www.geocities.com/norbachek](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/6534) (both addresses point to the same page).

My other webpages (my kmorg journal, the Press, etc) are all gone. Scott offered to put them up for me, at least temporarily, but I feel weird about using hosting he's paying for, for webpages that were in sore need of repair in the first place.

In the meantime, I'm going to rebuild my pages from scratch, at my own domain, probably with my own hosting. I'm going to keep posting to Rusted occasionally, but I've also set up a Blogger account, which I'm going to try and re-work my kmorg skin for until I can set up a Movable Type journal and import all the old posts.

So until further notice, look for me at [wordtyrant.blogspot.com](http://wordtyrant.blogspot.com), where I'll join the illustrious ranks of tequilamockingbird and her friends.
