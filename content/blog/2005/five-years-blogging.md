Five years ago today, KillingMachines came online, and I started weblogging. Since then, the site moved to rusty, then to rusted, and now to spaceninja, and we've gone from three admins to seven down to one. I've been online longer than this, but this particular weblog has been online for five years! Hooray!

I'm going to write up a more detailed history for my about page after I'm done with work.

**Edit:** As it turns out, I wasn't counting my time blogging on hatelife, or my earlier hand-coded journal. I've since added these to the archives, which brings my time online up to well over six years!
