I'm a loud person. I don't mean to be, but especially when I'm around kids, it seems I'm constantly getting shushed because I CAN'T CONTROL THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE. Lucky for me, everyone seems to be understanding about it. Still, last night Oskar was falling asleep (by which I mean, standing in his crib and screaming), and we were all outside eating dinner and talking. As I made a joke, I got a bit excited, and raised my voice too much. Annie shushed me, and the conversation moved on.

A few minutes later, Dave pointed out that Oskar was asleep, and had fallen asleep pretty quickly. I joked that he quit screaming after I was yelling. Clearly, it was me yelling that put him to sleep. From there, the joke evolved to Dave and Rose replacing the white noise CD they play for Oskar to fall asleep with one of me talking and yelling.

But there might be something to this. As a kid, did you ever fall asleep listening to the adults talking? You couldn't really understand what they were talking about, but I remember falling asleep upstairs listening to adults at a party downstairs, and Dave mentioned falling asleep around a campfire while adults chatted.

So we think we should release a series of CDs for kids called "Old People Talking", which are just recordings of a group of adults having coversations. Some tracks would be more distinct, like just a few adults talking over cocktails, while others might be more muffled, like several conversations filtering into a kids' bedroom.

The best part would be that to record it, we would find a group of people like my grandparents and their extended network of friends, and put them all on a bus and drive them down to a sound studio. We wouldn't tell them we were recording anything, we'd just set out some nice rugs and couches, and some plates of snacks and drinks and let them start talking. A single microphone would record the whole thing. I'm sure we'd get the "kids these days don't know what they're doing" track pretty quickly, and I bet we could get a "world war II stories" track without too much prompting.

We were joking around, but I bet a CD of old people talking would put a kid to sleep just as well as a white noise CD.
