I just had a neat idea for a web project -- 
  
A user-controlled voting booth. After registering, users would be invited to create their own polls, and cast their votes on other people's poll questions.  
  
I'd want to take this a step further than the 'democracy' we're used to, and allow users to add their own responses to each poll. So if you didn't like chocolate or vanilla, you could write in strawberry. If you didn't like any of the candidates, you could write in your own name, or write in "none of the above". And of course, each poll would have its own discussion board, which could get interesting.  
  
I'm at work and trolling the web, looking for something substantial and fun to mess around with, and I'm not finding anything suitable... That's how this idea occurred :) Anyone interested in this?  
  
Haha, think of the possibilities: "Do you like the color scheme of this site?"  
\* Yes  
\* No  
\* God no man  
\* Every time I surf here, I wish I was born blind  
  
Actually the first question will be, "What should this site be named?" And the leading answer will automatically be used as the site's name :)
