Recently, I tried to set up Trillian for some friends of mine, who both have an account on a single computer running XP. The problem is that by default, Trillian doesn't allow you to have different XP accounts have different Trillian profiles. If you set up User A's account under Trillian, and then log into XP as User B, Trillian will load as User A.

Well, there is a way to do it, although you have to follow a strange set of instructions. If you're curious, [here are the instructions](http://trillian.cc/forums/showthread.php?s=cc1d54aa163d53e3d17f75f1f7d961ed&threadid=70449&highlight=profile#post569715) I followed.

Basically, you completely uninstall Trillian, including existing profiles. Then you make a clean install, delete the default profile, and then create a new profile under Documents & Settings for each user. It's easier than it sounds, but still way more complex than it needs to be.
