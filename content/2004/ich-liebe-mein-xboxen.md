[Penny Arcade - Ich Liebe Mein Xboxen](http://www.penny-arcade.com/xboverview.php3 "Penny Arcade - Ich Liebe Mein Xboxen")

Here's an old review of the X-Box from Penny Arcade that's pretty funny. I agree with everything he says here, and I actually laughed out loud when I read his description of the X-Box's system menu:

> God help me, when you manipulate the menu system, you feel as though you are at the helm of the future. I hate myself for even saying that, but by accident or by design they succeeded in making it _cool_.
