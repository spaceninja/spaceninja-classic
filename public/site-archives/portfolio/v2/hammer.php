<p>Our senior project in my Graphic Design III class at Portland State University was to submit a cover for Print magazine, which has a student cover contest every year. My design was heavily influenced by Russian propaganda imagery, and featured a student wielding a T-square like a sledgehammer. This design tied for fifth place in my class.</p>
