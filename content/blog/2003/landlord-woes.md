So, the satellite installation guy showed up this morning at 9am, only to find out that we didn't have written permission from our landlord yet, who is hemming and hawing over whether or not to allow this.

**Landlord:** So why do you want this instead of cable?
**Me:** Well, it's cheaper, installation is free, and it comes with a free TiVO-like system.
**Landlord:** How much cheaper?
**Me:** Installation is free, and it costs $5 less per month.
**Landlord:** It's only $5 cheaper?
**Me:** Well, yes, plus no installation fees, and the TiVO system.
**Landlord:** Hmm.

So the landlord had to talk to the installer to see what the options were, which the installer explained (very patiently), at the end of which, the landlord decided that he couldn't decide now, and could we reschedule?

So now my satellite might be installed on Saturday morning, and the landlord is going to swing by the house tomorrow to check out the possible mounting spots.

Appearently, rather than use the existing cable hole which comes in right behind the TV, he wants to mount over the attic and drill through there, or something.

Ugh. I have got to get a house. I'm so tired of having to deal with the landlord every time we want to do anything.

Oh, and before anyone chimes in to defend the landlord by saying "Well, it is his property, and he can make decisions he wants", You're absolutely right, and I understand that. But that doesn't make it any less frustrating when he won't put gutters on the house, or let us get a cat (without paying more rent), or any of the other problems we've had with him.

I've said it before: When your landlord is a person who wants to be your friend, it's a bad situation. You're better off with a faceless corporation, oddly enough, because at least they enact common-sense rules and stick to them, rather than make decisions on the spot, change their minds later, and deny they ever changed their minds.
