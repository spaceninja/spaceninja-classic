Ron Moore of Battlestar Galactica's take on [technobabble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technobabble):

> A deeper truth is, I was never interested in coming up with an explanation for Why? Never. I mean, I suppose I could've come up with a sufficiently important-sounding bit of technobabble that would've made sense (you see, the Cylon double-talk sensors tracking the Olympic Carrier's nonsense drive signature needed 15 minutes to relay the made-up data wave through the pretend continuum, then the Cylon navigational hyper silly system needed another 10 minutes to recalculate the flux capacitor, etc.) but what would that have really added to the drama? \-- [Ron Moore's Blog](http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/01/index.html)
