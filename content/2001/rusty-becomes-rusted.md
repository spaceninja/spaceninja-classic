As you have no doubt noticed, Rusty has now become Rusted.KMorg. The reason for this is that Rusted Killing Machines sounds like decaying industrial machinery, as opposed to Rusty, which sounds like your hick cousin from down south, who raises pigs.

Yes, we're aware that everything is still labeled as Rusty... we'll be fixing all the references, graphics and links over the next few days.
