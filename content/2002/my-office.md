I spend at least 8 hours a day sitting a room measuring 8 feet by 7 feet. My desk is against one wall, and holds my 19 inch monitor that I stare at all day long and wonder if it's giving me cancer. My decent speakers and the subwoofer I got from Egghead when the store closed are plugged into the soundcard that's built into my motherboard, but I don't think I can really tell the difference between it and an expensive sound card. The speakers are playing a large playlist that contains approximately 8 gigabytes of mp3s, and if you want to, you can [listen](http://radio.spaceninja.com:8000/) to it, too. The phone cord runs from the wall to my left to my DSL modem, which is sitting on top of my computer under my desk on my right. An ethernet cable snakes up the wall to the hub-switch I mounted on the wall. Two more ethernet cables come out of the hub, one running back down to my computer, and one running out the door up around the ceiling of the living room to Annie's computer. The door to the living room is to my right, and to my left is a little tiny window, with a view onto the street. There's some pegs above the window, that a bunch of headphones are hanging on. Directly above my computer on the wall is an old light fixture, which has no lights in it because they shone in my eyes, and I bought a torch lamp instead. A little Cthulu doll is sitting on the light fixture. There is a shelf on the wall to my left, which holds at least seven books on HTML, two on PHP, and numerous others, as well as a jar full of dice from my roleplaying days, and some toys (an orc, a space marine, and a zerg). There's a CD rack in the back left corner, holding all my computer-related CDs, and a wire-mesh trash can in the back right corner, which the previous tenant left here, but I kind of liked, so I kept it. Sitting on top of the CD rack is the silver-plated, engraved mouse that KT got me. Hanging on the walls are an old ID from when I worked on the tek team, a Blues Brothers poster, two [Obey Giant](http://www.obeygiant.com/) posters, An iMac poster, a Barbarella poster, and a poster of the Mac G4 cube. I think I'm going to buy more Macintosh posters. Hanging in the middle of the G4's monitor is the Ninja Star that Miles got me for Christmas.

I spend more than 8 hours a day in this room, almost every day of the week. And I love it!

My non-work accomplishments this week:

- I set up an FCS [family weblog](http://dysnomia.spaceninja.com/) for David.
- I got Apache up and running on my computer, and found out how to make symbolic links on a windows machine, so I didn't have to copy everything into the Apache public directory (If you're interested, the utility for this is called [Junction](http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/source/misc.shtml#junction), and I got it from [sysinternals.com](http://www.sysinternals.com)).
- Deciding to give [Zach](http://www.hatelife.org/view.php?user=blackflag) an admin account here on Rusted so that I won't feel the need to post long, rambling descriptions of my room just so there's a new post on the front page.

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Shortly after I set up my streaming music, I shut it down due to changes in the laws that made it illegal.
