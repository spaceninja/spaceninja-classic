<p>I retooled my personal weblog to use modern web standards and semantic design. This two-column layout is created entirely using CSS, and the XHTML code is wholly structural, with all design being relegated to the CSS file to allow for easy redesigns. The design was meant to focus on typography and readability, so graphical elements were kept to a minimum. The header image is a photo of the Washington Street bridge in Indianapolis.</p>
