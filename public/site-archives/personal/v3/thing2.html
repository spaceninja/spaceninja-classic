                <br><b>Scott Vandehey - The Urban Legend</b>
                <br><i>by Pat Todd</i>

                <p>Though I don't know him well, I feel familiar with him. Meeting just a few
                  times, it was easy to see that he'd fit right in as one of my friends. We
                  like most of the same things, and I'm sure that given a week or so we could
                  turn each other onto the things that are different about each of us.

                <p>Why Urban Legend you ask? Well, as the story goes, my roomie Urn and I met
                  this strange young vixen (Annie if you must know) in the fall quarter of
                  98-99. She then proceeded to dominate the conversation for some time. We
                  fell in love with her. She told us tales of this mystical boyfriend of
                  hers, and how we reminded her of him. His name was Scott. We didn't want
                  to share her (who does really?) so we deceided that the person known as
                  Scott didn't exist. He was merely another aspect of Annie to shroud
                  herself into further mystery.

                <p>Later in the year, it was proclaimed that a visit from the non-existant
                  Scott was to occur. We were ready for a two-bit actor to play the part,
                  but were much surprised to learn the truth. Scott Vandehey existed, and
                  was pretty cool really. We immediatly changed our window sign (a movie
                  sign with changeable text), to "He Exists!" Most everybody figured that
                  we'd discovered Jesus. Pretty funny really when all we done was meet
                  Scott. Definitely Not Jesus.

                <p>So now that there was truth behind the myth of Scott. He exists and
                  continues to do so (although I've heard of some attempts on his
                  life...). He was the significant other to her royal shortness, and really,
                  just a barrier to a strawberry desert.

                <p>Still, for all the world I wouldn't seperate the two, as I aspire to
                  someday be an Urban Myth myself.

                <p>
