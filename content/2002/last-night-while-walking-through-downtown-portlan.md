Last night, while walking through downtown Portland with Zach, we ran into two people he sort of knew. They introduced themselves by saying what name they posted to LiveJournal as.  
  
1) It took some restraint to not start telling them how much happier they would be with a KillingMachines journal. ;)  
  
2) I'm having trouble adapting to the fact that while web sites, by and large, are still something geeky that not everyone has, weblogs are as common as email addresses or cell phones. Don't get me wrong, I think this is a great change. People shouldn't be intimidated by technology, and the wide-spread acceptance of weblogs as something fun makes me very happy. But I don't think I ever dreamed I'd be able to introduce myself someday as "I'm Scott from KillingMachines." -----
