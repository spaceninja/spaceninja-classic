Well, we're just about finished moving in here. On Sunday, the woman in the office gave us a whole load of crap about how she couldn't let us have the apartment because our cosigner (my dad) has perfect credit, but not enough of it. Three hours later, after a phone call from my parents, and running a credit check on my mom also, she finally says that she'll let us have the place. We've been unpacking since then. Cable works. Internet works (on Annie's computer, mine's fuxored). The phone works. On the whole, I think we're coming out winners.

I'm going to be a DJ. The college radio station [KCWU](http://www.cwu.edu/~kcwu/) is looking for volunteer DJs. This would never have happened to me in Portland. All the radio stations are highly competitive, and I think the college radio station is limited to communication majors. So this is totally rad. Because it's a college station, I can play whatever I want as long as I follow a few simple rules like not playing any "red-sticker" tracks (swearing) and that I play 6 rotation songs per hour. So given that I play a few songs that are on the station's current playlist, I can play anything I want in between! _KICK-ASS!!!_

Now I just need to find a paying job.
