Except for sales, that song pretty accurately sums up my life right now. It's crazy how just one or two changes can throw your whole life in disarray. Due to a couple of changes recently, I've been trying to reorganize and get things figured out. Here are some of my goals.

- Get more organized and efficient at work.
- Set aside a regular block of time for web design.
- Finish the last few things on my personal to-do list, like sending backup CDs to the last few fojar people.
- Clean up the house and quit living like a slob.
- Figure out our finances (this one is well on-track since our bank visit, but we're still getting used to the new setup, and there are a few wrinkles to iron out).
- Start saving some money and quit living from paycheck to paycheck (Again, this is mostly on-track, but it involves some changes to our spending habits that will take some getting used to).
- Get the spaceninja photoblog set up and start posting photos regularly.
- Post to this blog more frequently.
- Make my posts more interesting and less listing of things I did (this goal and the previous one may be in conflict).
- Exercise and Diet (Already in progress, and going pretty well. I'm actually having much more trouble convincing myself to exercise every day than to stick to the diet).

The ones I'm most interested in right now are the scheduling ones. I feel really unproductive and I think I'm wasting a lot of time every day. If I can get some good time-management strategies in place now, that will help down the road as distractions like Halo 2 and Half-Life 2 enter my life.
