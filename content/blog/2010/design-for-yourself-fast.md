> "Design for yourself fast. You shouldn’t need to think about what you want, you are what you want. It just comes out of you, and it will be good. But sometimes, you have this feeling that you have to think about it like you would for some detached client project where they sell gutters; your stuff ain’t like that, you know it by heart… so design it by heart. Fast. Don’t get trapped."
