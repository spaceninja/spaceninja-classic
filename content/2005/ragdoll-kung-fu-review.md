What do you get when you cross ragdoll physics in a game engine with cheesy kung fu movies? You get a crazy little fighting game called [Ragdoll Kung Fu](http://www.ragdollkungfu.com/), which is like nothing you've ever played before.

When you start the game, you are treated to a hilariously bad loading movie styled after low-budget 70's kung-fu films. It has clearly been filmed by the developers themselves in costumes consisting of skullcaps, fake moustaches, and video game t-shirts. Once the menu loads, you immediately notice that in addition to the usual "campaign" mode and multiplayer options, there are several "Secret Features" which can be unlocked by playing the single-player campaign. The menu music is a surprisingly decent hiphop tribute to martial arts styles. Under the Options, you find the usual resolution and controls, but also an option to enable the "film grain" filter, which gives the same beat-to-hell third-generation-VHS-dub quality so familiar in kung fu films from the neighborhood video store.

Bookending every single-player level are more of the awesomely low-budget movies with the developers introducing the characters being played or fought in each level. The storyline is an unremarkable journey from the training dojo garden level through to fighting the bad guy (a black boxer with an afro - possibly a tribute to Jim Kelly?) who kidnaps the girl. However, it's delivered with a wink and a nod, and it's clear that the "actors" had a blast filming the scenes.

The basics of the gameplay are simplistic, and the training level does an excellent job of showing the basics. However, the ragdoll metaphore is not quite accurate - the characters behave more like puppets on strings, that you can throw around the screen. Walking consists of grabbing a character's hand (or head) and dragging across the screen, leaving their feet trailing behind, attempting to keep up. Jumping is accomplished by hurling your character around, which is great fun. Fighting is slightly more complicated, with basic attacks being done by right-click-dragging a body part towards the foe. The strength of the hit is controlled by your "chi" level, which is controlled by constantly spinning your mouse cursor. It quickly becomes natural to keep your chi level high by always spinning your cursor, but fast-paced fights against multiple opponents can be overwhelming.

In fact, it seems that the developers never intended for serious fights to go beyond one-on-one, because in every case where you fight multiple foes, you are provided with butterflies, which allow you to power up to throw fireballs or lightning. This is awesomely powerful, and can easily allow you to defeat multiple opponents.

While the storyline is cheesy fun, and the movies are goofy, the thing that kept me playing was unlocking the secrets. Almost every multiplayer or single-player (non-campaign) mode are unlocked by collecting stars during the campaign. You can also unlock "mixer tracks", which are visible on the main menu, and allow you to control the volume of several different audio tracks, to customize your own theme song. It's not a full-fledged mixer, as each track is more than a single instrument, but it's still fun, and surprisingly addictive when you unlock one and the game informs you that there are still more to find.

I haven't had much time to try out the multiplayer modes yet, but I checked a few single-player ones, and along with items like "long jump" and "high jump", there is the "soccer" mod (pictured above), where you fight a computer apponent to kick a soccer ball to the opposite side of the screen. I sucked at this. I'm very interested in the possibilities of the movie recorder mode, however, which seems to hint at the ability to produce [machinima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima) quite easily. You can import your own soundtracks and skins as well, so now you can finally make that movie you've always wanted where [Conan O'Brian](http://apbit.com/rdkf/conanobrienskin.html) fights a [Combine Trooper](http://www.rdkf.net/index.php?module=download&do=showfile&id=17&sid=f781ca21e708c07615a4bdfe9738aba7) from Half Life 2 to the tune of "Fly Me To The Moon."

In summary, the gameplay is groundbreaking and entirely new, while the laughably bad storyline and movies are made up for by the secret features, skinnability, and infectious spirit of fun that the game was made with. Plus, it only costs $15 on Steam.
