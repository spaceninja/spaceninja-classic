Tonight we watched my new "Best of the Muppet Show" DVD... the first of four available on [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/30943/ref=pd_iis_sai/002-8637419-3911214) right now. This one has three episodes, Peter Sellers, Dudley Moore, and John Cleese! They were all good, but the John Cleese one was hilarious.  
  
I hadn't seen the show in years. Honestly, I think the last time I actually saw an episode was when I was a kid and it was still on TV. It's a very different experience watching it now. While the show is definitely set up so kids can enjoy it (lots of slapstick, funny voices, muppets), there's also a suprising amount of jokes that kids just wouldn't get, so that you begin getting the impression that the visuals are aimed at kids, while the dialog is aimed at adults.
