Watching the appendices from the Special Edition Lord of the Rings DVD - The special effects guys have clearly spent the last several years thinking **BIG**. They casually talk about working up "miniatures" the size of baseball diamonds, or spending a month filming an entire scene inside a computer. So when you hear one of these guys mention that they considered making a miniature of the pillared hallway from Moria, but the number of pillars made it "prohibitive," you realize that these guys have lost all sense of perspective. They don't think small anymore. Whenever you hear "prohibitive," think "FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE."

You can almost imagine them saying "Oh, yeah, we thought about a life-size model of the Pyramids at Giza, but it would have been prohibitive." Or, "We did some research into cloning a cave troll, but it was prohibitive."

This movie is amazing.
