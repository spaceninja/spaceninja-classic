Ha ha dream on scott... the future is in little plastic electrical-powered cars: no power, no pickup... just slow whirring annoyance. You won't even get to drive the damn things, they'll be computer guided! OH HOORAY I CAN HAVE MY HANDS FREE TO BRUSH MY TEETH OR PLAY GAMEBOY WHILE THE MAGIC BOX FERRIES ME TO WORK IN THE SLAVE MINES OF MONKOR. **Bah!!!!**

That's why I'm gonna get a big Impala while I still can. Or maybe a '73 Chevy Nova, I have a soft spot for the Nova... or a Mustang, even... so long as it's big, and fast, and loud, and belches smog and gets like 5 or 11 miles to the gallon! Yeah, hell yeah! Crime against Mother Earth is the _ultimate_ luxury! That, and [geocities sites featuring AC/DC midis.](http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/Garage/3372/gallery.html) You... shook me all night long, ooh~~~

> She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean She was the best damn woman that I ever seen She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies Knocking me out with those American thighs
