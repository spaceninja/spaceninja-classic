goddammit... My friend's wedding is this weekend, at the beach. This is a good thing. Annie and I made plans with my parents to go to the beach cabin for the weekend, and they'll drop us off at the wedding. I don't want to learn to drive, but this bumming rides off people sucks. Anyway, so we made these plans like a month ago, and about two weeks ago, I asked my boss for Friday (today) off. He said no problem.

Last night, I get an email from my whiny bitch supervisor, Mr. Beamer, announcing that we're doing the scheduling for finals week at the tek meeting on Friday (today). Sense the conflict?

So I send him a polite email informing him that I won't be at the tek meeting because I have the day off, and here is my finals schedule, could he please try to get me some hours? I need in the neighborhood of 20 hours, and I would prefer to not work weekends. Other than that, I left it open. Not a big deal. I've seen Beamer do scheduling for other people who couldn't make meetings.

So I wander into the tek office this morning to print something out for the class I have to attend before leaving for my beach weekend, and beamer wanders in.

"Beamer, did you get my email?" "Yeah, how come you won't be at the meeting?" (accusing tone) "I have the day off." "Okay, well, I'll see if I can get you some hours, but no promises, since you couldn't attend the meeting. It is mandatory."

WTF???

"Beamer, I'm going to the beach for my friend's wedding. I've had these plans for a month, and I've already gotten the day off. I'm not slacking here. You just announced this meeting yesterday, and it's too late for me to change my plans." "Did Shem give you the day off?" "Yes. Like two weeks ago." "Oh. Well, I'll see what I can get you then. Shem really needs to tell me these things."

WHAT??? I felt like blowing up. Shem doesn't need to tell you SHIT you cock master! You power-tripping mother fucker! HOW DARE YOU come at me with an accusing tone like that! I had the day off. I am correct. YOU are the one in the wrong here! Oh my god! You arrogant fuck!

He'll TRY to schedule me some hours. Well thank you! It's very kind of you to go so far out of your way for me! I'll be grateful for whatever piss-ant amount of hours you choose to a lot to me!

I swear, if I come back to find I have less than 12 hours on the schedule I'm going ballistic. As is, I think I'm going to complain to my (and his) boss.
