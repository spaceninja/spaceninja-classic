My trip to Phoenix was great! Business-wise, we had two [meetings](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/kent-lynn-brian.jpg), one [full-day meeting](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/meeting02.jpg) on [Friday](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/meeting03.jpg), and one half-day meeting on [Saturday](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/meeting05.jpg). It was great to finally meet everyone [face-to-face](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/dave-mogenns.jpg), and we really got [a lot of details](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/myview.jpg) sorted out about the new product we're [developing](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/peptalk.jpg).  
  
The hotel we stayed in was amazing. It's called the [Wyndam Buttes](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/skylight.jpg), and it has an amazing view of the city, which really shows [how flat Phoenix is](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/panorama.jpg). The thing I was most impressed with was how they had built the entire hotel to be multi-layered, up the side of the [hill](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/mountain.jpg) (one of about 2 [hills](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/hill.jpg) in all of Phoenix). As a result, instead of [one big pool](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/pool.jpg) and a couple of jacuzzis, they had two big pools, connected together, with stairs going uphill to the two jacuzzis, and a [water slide](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/waterslide.jpg) descending a level to a smaller pool, which was right outside [my](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/room01.jpg) [room](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/room02.jpg). The "ground floor" where we entered the hotel, was actually the fifth floor, and you accessed the lower levels via elevators across a [skybridge](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/skybridge.jpg). Even the [lobby](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/lobby.jpg) was designed to look like the outer [desert](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/cactus.jpg), complete with a [waterfall](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/waterfall.jpg), emptying into a [coy pond](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/waterfallcoy.jpg) in the restaurant downstairs, which flowed [outside](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/poolfall.jpg) down another waterfall emptying into the pool.  
  
Our first night there, we had an (expensive!) dinner at the "[Top Of The Rock](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/topofrock.jpg)" restaurant, where I got a nice [view](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/topofrockview.jpg) of the [sunset](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/sunset01.jpg) over [downtown](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/phoenix/sunset02.jpg).  
  
After I got home, I had a nice birthday. Just about everyone came over, and we drank White Russians and watched _[Scratch](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0143861)_, a documentary about hip-hop and turntablism. Eric gave me an awesome [bottle of vodka](http://www.redarmyvodka.com/home.htm), and the next day, a bunch of us went to [ElectroFish](http://www.dailypdx.com/bar/bar.02.07.03.shtml), a local sushi bar that plays downtempo music.
