In the last week:

- Annie's grandmother died
- Zoe spent her first period of time apart from Annie (3 days)
- Burrito (our cat) is not eating, which is how her sister started deteriorating before we had to put her down.
- I worked a 66-hour work week
- Our friend Eric was in a motorcycle accident (he's got road rash, but is otherwise okay)
- Annie's dad and brother Zach totaled a car trying to get to the funeral (they're fine, the car is not)
- Annie strained her knee, and is on crutches

Our friends and family have been overwhelmingly supportive, and we've managed to scrape together enough money to cover the unexpected doctor and veterinarian bills, so we're doing well, but are mentally and physically exhausted. Tomorrow morning we're driving to Walla Walla for the funeral. We're coming back on Sunday, and then I've got a couple days off so we can slow down a bit and try to regain our sanity.
