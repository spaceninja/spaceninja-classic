Two weeks ago, Annie and I found out that we're pregnant!

**The Big Details** The doctor says that we got pregnant the first week that Annie was in Portland. That means we're just over seven weeks right now, and puts the due date on June 6th or 7th. (There's a chance our kid will be born on 6/6/06, so if you see horns or a cute little forked tail in the first photos, you'll know why). Obviously, we don't know if it's a boy or a girl yet, but we're going to find out once we can. If it's a boy, we're planning on John Henry (after our grandfathers), and if it's a girl, Zoe Middle-name-to-be-determined.

**Finding Out** A few weeks ago, Annie was complaining that her boobs were sore and that she was starving all the time. Being the college-educated geniuses that we are, neither of us put two and two together. Still, after a few days, Annie said she was going to take a pregnancy test. Neither of us got our hopes up, because we've been through that several times, and been disappointed each time. However, I had done such a good job of not getting my hopes up, that I basically didn't consider the possibility that it would be positive. When Annie climbed into my shower with a grin on her face, my first thought was "Why are you in my shower? I'm trying to shave here!"

Once Annie told me that the test was positive, though, I was very excited. We cancelled our plans for the day, and went to Planned Parenthood to confirm the test. Several hours later, we had a definite positive result, and had to figure out how it would be most fun to tell our parents.

**Telling The Stockfolks** We couldn't find my Dad, and my Mom was at the beach, so we drove up to Milton to tell Annie's parents the day we found out. We wanted to get Dave and Rose over to the Stockfolks' house for dinner so we could tell everyone together, but couldn't think of a way to get them over without tipping our hand. I decided that we might be able to get Dave to help us trick Rose, so I called him and asked if he was somewhere where Rose could hear him. He said yes (thinking that's what I wanted) and put me on speakerphone. I tried to bluster through it without actually saying our news, but I knew they had already guessed. Still, it worked out, because then we were able to surprise the Stockfolks, who thought they were just coming over to Dave and Rose's for dinner.

Annie picked up Oskar and waited by the door, and when her Mom walked in, she quickly asked "Do you want another one of these?" Now, I always figured that Annie telling her Mom would result in a lot of screaming, but it went the other way. She was completely speechless. For a good two minutes, Annie just stood there smiling while her Mom stammered out half-formed sentences. Eventually, Mrs. Stockman regained the use of her higher brain functions and there was much rejoicing.

On a side note, Mrs. Stockman said that when she told Annie's Aunt Tawney, she got the screaming reaction we were expecting.

**Telling The Vande-folks** It was much easier to surprise my family, since we're frequently stopping by the house to pick up Sean or our mail. So we just arrived one night after Mom got back from the beach, and once Mom and Dad were in the same room, we asked if they had any plans for June. Dad, always the practical uber-planner, started talking about actual plans, and Mom and I shared a quick look that told me she had already figured it out, but was waiting for Dad to catch up. Once he did, there were lots of hugs and congratulations.

Then Dad got excited and went rummaging around in his desk. He had a present that he had put away about a year ago, knowing this day was coming. When he pulled it out, it was a little bib that has an emroidered picture of Peter Rabbit that says "Scott loves Peter Rabbit". My Mom began explaining that this was my Dad's bib when he was a kid, which caused a bit of laughter, given that it said "Scott" in big letters. Then Mom dug out some unrelated strawberry-themed gift that she had for Annie "just because".

**Telling The Internet** I've been putting off writing this post because I'm just a little bit superstitious, and I didn't want to jinx us (most of the things that can go wrong in a pregnancy happen in the first twelve weeks). But, I've come to realize that's silly. As Rose put it, you tell the people you would want support from, and if, god forbid, anything did go wrong, I would want to be able to talk about it here and get the support of my friends. So anyways, here's the post that I've been putting off writing, and I'm sure there will be many more to come.

**The Baby's Website** Right now, I'm working on the skeleton of a [baby website](http://baby.spaceninja.com/). (Duh). Right now, all that's up is a little baby statistics page that I worked up. I'll be posting about it later. Eventually, that page will have design and content and stuff like that. I'm also still debating about whether it's better to just stick with one blog and post baby information here, or break it up and keep baby-related posts on the new site, and leave this one more geek focussed.
