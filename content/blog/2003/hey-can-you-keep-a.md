Hey... Can you keep a secret?

\[_Scott leans closer, and speaks in a conspiratorial whisper:_\]

I'm enjoying my job again. Keep it quiet, but in the last week or so, things have actually been improving! My boss has regained the realization that our company is only going to survive if we put some programmer hours into active product development. He's not only suddenly into development, he's **really** into it! He's practically issued communication blackouts for the programmers so they can focus on their jobs without being distracted by client "bug" reports and feature demands.

He's had me compile a list of our 20 most critical bugs and features for our part-timer and one of our full-time programmers to focus on. And our other full-time programmer is being wholly aimed at product development to meet the needs of our largest client, which means that features and notes that Steve and I made a year ago about things our products were lacking are suddenly being paid attention to! Some of them have already been completed!

We're even discussing the need for **documentation!** (there should be heavenly light shining down on that word, and a choir of angels singing praises... You don't understand how important documentation can be until you support a product that has none).

Just thought I'd let you know. Things are going well at the moment. For all I know it could be the calm moment of sunshine before the storm, but believe me, I'm enjoying it while it lasts!
