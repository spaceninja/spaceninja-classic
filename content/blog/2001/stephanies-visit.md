well, stephanie's gone home... we're both pretty sad about that. i miss her more than i'd thought possible, but we've decided it's a good thing it's so hard for us to be far away from one another, because it's a constant reminder of what a good thing we have going.

we did have a great time, though.. on wednesday, stephanie finally got the lobster dinner she won in a bet nearly 9 months ago, and while we were eating my car got broken into and my new stereo stolen.

on thursday, we went to the coast and my puppy dog pi nearly caught a bird! she was darting along the edge of the ocean, chasing a seagull that was floating in about a foot of water, as the four of us walked along. all of a sudden, she ran out into the water and pounced on the bird! much flapping of wings and splashing occurred, and the bird got away.. but i was so proud of my puppy dog :~) she's growing up!

on friday we spent most of the day with family, although we had a surreal experience on larch mountain (which i will let stephanie talk about ... )...

on saturday, stephanie got to enjoy the best meal experience ever for the very first time - dim sum! it's chinese breakfast/lunch, mostly meat and vegetable fillings inside little pastries, but the treat is how it's served to you. when you sit down at the table, you're given tea and plates but nothing else. suddenly, as if by magic, food is brought to you on little carts! all of the carts are piled high with tiny serving trays of food, and you point to the items you want. so the novice ends up with about 10 items off the first cart, and misses out on all the best stuff (breaded lobster, shrimp toast, bbq pork buns, and of course, the coconut jello for dessert)..

saturday night we toured my childhood home... and sunday she left.

and then the sadness commenced.
