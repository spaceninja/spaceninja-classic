I can't help it. I'm feeling good today.

I'm still unemployed, still uninsured, and there's a million follow-up calls to make, and there's still boxes all over the house to be unpacked, and then there's the pile of boxes that I left here four years ago to sort through . . . but I'm still feeling good. Can't shake it.

1. I got a job interview today, the first one since arriving in this godforsaken hellhole of a job market. Stupid Portland.

But the interview went well, I have a good feeling. Not a good "I nailed this job, nobody else has a chance" feeling, but a good, "I did my best, and it went well" kind of feeling. The manager's going to call me sunday/monday to let me know what's up, and either way I still feel good about it.

2. Yesterday the mailwoman brought a few boxes, which turned out to be the books and CD's from our missing box! (The one that got lost in transit because I didn't seal it properly and never got around to inventorying the contents of each box and labeling them so we could track their arrival and would know if anything got lost . . . stupid Ryan). So now we have most of our books back, although there's still a few that didn't come back, and we got a few books that weren't ours. Go figure.

3. I have some good ideas for a few projects around the house, including the following:

> \- Move one set of bookshelves out of the corner in our room and build a little platform extending the bottom shelf, so Leilani can have a little private corner to sleep in.
>
> \- Attach the moved shelves to opposite wall, and build a connecting table/desk unit so we have an extra work area in the house (and a spot for our inevitable second computer, whenever we have the funds for it).
>
> \- Build a shelf unit for the basement, to hold the tv, vcr, sean's x-box, and my ps2, plus storage for games/accessories. Now that we've got the switcher from Scott, we just need a few cables to connect everything together without having to constantly switch plugs every time we switch game system. We just need a more stable storage unit for them (right now, everything's stacked on top of each other).

It'll be a lot of measuring, a bunch of cutting and assembling, but it's a couple of good weekend projects, and it'll help me feel better about things.

Of course, as I said, I'm feeling pretty good today.
