Job Update: When Annie called back the deli today, they said they were calling people later in the day. Sure enough, later on, they called her back for an interview tomorrow. No mention of me. I'm going to call them tomorrow. Then when Annie called Thunderbird Motel, a confused looking person said "What? No, we're not hiring!" and hung up on her! This would be bad enough on it's own, but this is the SECOND time they've done this! About a month ago, they were advertising in the paper, and when I applied, they said they'd call back in a week. After a week, when I hadn't heard from them, I called them back, only to find out that they were never hiring to begin with! Now it's happened twice! Aggh! I'm going to check a couple other places in the paper tomorrow. There's a shirt printing place in town that wants a graphics person with Macintosh experience that I think I can talk my way into.
