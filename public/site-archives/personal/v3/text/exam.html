<font size=4><b>Cakes And Ale</b></font>

<br>During an  examination one day in a Cambridge class, a bright young student popped
up and asked the proctor to bring him Cakes and Ale. The following dialog
ensued:

<p>Proctor: I beg your pardon?

<p>Student: Sir, I request that you bring me Cakes and Ale.

<p>Proctor: Sorry, no.

<p>Student: Sir, I really must insist. I request and require that you bring me
Cakes and Ale.

<p>At this point, the student produced a copy of the four hundred year old Laws
of Cambridge, written in Latin and still nominally in effect, and pointed to
the section which read (rough translation from the Latin):

<p>"Gentlemen sitting examinations may request and require Cakes and Ale."

<p>Pepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student sat
there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.

<p>Three weeks later the student was fined five pounds for not wearing a sword
to the examination.
