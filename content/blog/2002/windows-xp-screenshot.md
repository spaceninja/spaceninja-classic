Here's my [screenshot](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation.php?id=143223) of my system running Microsoft Fisher-Price Windows XP.

For me, the thing that's really making this OS worthwhile is all the little touches that they've added. It's all minor stuff that doesn't really matter, but now that it's there, it really makes the experience better. Things like transparent icon text on the desktop, so I don't have to run a separate program to do that. Support for .zip files is built in, so I don't need WinZip anymore. You can right-click on a graphic and there's an option to set it as your wallpaper. And about five hundred more little details like that, that Microsoft finally got right. I'm really having fun using my computer again.

So even though Steve doesn't think much of me for using it, I'd have to say that I really enjoy XP, and I'm not ashamed of it.

Also, I'm completely addicted to the little emoticons in Trillian. I keep wanting to pepper my emails with (santa) and (nutty) and that little smiley face with the mustache on it. I am a little ashamed about that.
