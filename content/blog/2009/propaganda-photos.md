Some of you may remember [Obey Fojar](http://web.archive.org/web/20020330150933/http://obey.fojar.com/) from back in the day, my rather blatant knock-off of the propaganda stylings of Obey Giant. That site isn't even online anymore, and although I have it archived, I'm not going to restore it because, wow, that's some bad stuff. Take photo, run posterize photoshop filter, convert colors to black and red, and post as original artwork! \*shudder\*

Still, the [source photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/sets/72157607867852760/) are good for a laugh.

While I was going through my photo archives to upload old photos to Flickr, I stumbled across the directory with these photos.

We took these in the tek room for the express purpose of converting into propaganda images. They were taken with the strong backlight provided by a halogen torch light behind the subject.

The pose was much more important than the actual subject or props used. Since we were in the tek room, we mostly had computer equipment around.

The idea was that we would photoshop the various computer equipment out with more standard communist props like scythes or bushels of wheat.

In this case, a t-square stood in for a sledgehammer. In fact, I later [submitted that one to Print Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20021204031351/www.spaceninja.com/port/images/print.m.html) for the student cover design competition, and placed for my school.

The skull seems obvious, but I have no excuse for the beard, the pose, or the sound card.
