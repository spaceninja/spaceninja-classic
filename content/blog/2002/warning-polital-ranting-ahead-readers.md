_Warning! Polital Ranting Ahead! Readers with a Class 5 or lower Political Tolerance Level should not read this post!_

[According to this article](http://apnews.excite.com/article/20020826/D7LL7ECO1.html), President Bush has been advised that he does not require Congressional approval to attack Iraq.

Or, to phrase it more plainly... The president who wasn't elected is now thinking about starting a war that the American people don't necessarily want.

HOORJ!
