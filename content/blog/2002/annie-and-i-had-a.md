Annie and I had a great weekend visiting our friends. Gavin is **huge** now. He speaks in nearly complete sentences and has an amazing imagination. He's also very much his father's son, and **loves** his monster truck toys.

After we got home, we went by Fry's and I finally picked up the 80 GB hard drive I've been wanting to get for awhile ($89 after rebate! w00t!). Unfortunately, it's taking freaking forever to copy all the contents of the old drive onto the new one. But once it's done, I'll finally have more disk space, and Annie will finally have some disk space.

Oh, and my copy of the special edition Lord of the Rings showed up yesterday! I pre-ordered it on Amazon, figuring I'd get it a week after it came out, since they'd have to ship it. Instead, I got it a day before! So at this weekend's Secret Project Saturday, we'll all be watching the newly-expanded version!
