Who would have pictured me as an overworker? I certainly wouldn't have. But lately, I have been getting a bit overwhelmed. Without getting too into details, I've been doing a lot more customer service work than I ever thought I would have to do. I'm not good at this work, and it's stressing me out. In addition, since I work from home, and my job depends a lot on when Steve is working, I'm having trouble dividing between "work time" and "play time". As a result, here are my resolutions to help lower my stress:  
  
**Resolution 1)** Learn to ask for help. Mogenns has offered to play backup for me, and I need to take him up on that when the crazy customer situations roll in.  
  
**Resolution 2)** Learn to walk away. Just because Steve decides he wants to work from 9pm to midnight, doesn't mean that I have to do so, especially if I've already been online the rest of the day for work. I need to learn how to walk away from the computer when my "shift" is over. If anyone needs me, they know my phone number.  
  
**Resolution 3)** While this is a great job, it is just a job. I need to keep that in mind when I get all stressed out. If things are horrible, step away from the computer for a little bit and relax.  
  
I've never run into this before... as many of my former bosses will tell you. \*cough\*SHEM\*cough\* I think it's because I'm working in the same room at the same computer that I play at, and with all the advantages that provides, it does tend to blur the line between work and fun, and sometimes you need that line to maintain your sanity.
