The latest RPG I've been playing doesn't have very good graphics. In fact, it's text-based. It's [UrbanDead.com](http://urbandead.com/), and it's a "Massively Multi-Player Web-Based Zombie Apocalypse." It's simplistic, but fun. Basically, you create a character by choosing a profession, which decides which skill you start the game with. Military and Policemen start with a pistol and know how to shoot, while Scientists start with first-aid kits and know how to heal people, for example. You are limited to 50 "actions" every day, which includes shooting, healing, walking, etc. Action Points regenerate one every half-hour, so you can't spend all day playing, and it's built around the idea that most people will only log into their character once a day, so it's very low-commitment.

There's no quests or goals other than gaining experience to get better skills, but it's still suprisingly fun, and they're tweaking the rules and adding new features on a very frequent basis.

But the best part is that if you die, you wake up again as a zombie, and keep playing the game from the opposing team. It's a little frustrating the first time your character gets zombified, but playing as a zombie is fun, too.

Check it out, and if you see Gary Dirin online, say hello, because that's my Doctor character.
