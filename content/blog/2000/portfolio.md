I got my portfolio all updated today. The itch to redesign all my personal sites has been hitting me again lately. I found a good design online and pretty much stole it wholesale for my portfolio site. I would feel bad about it on any other site, but since all the content on that site is designs that I've done, I don't mind that the framework is based on another site. It's funny how much of design is outright copying. You put your own twist on it, and call it an homage, and you're good to go! Anyway, check it out when you get a chance. I also reworked this site a little. Nothing major, I just put all the entries from 1999 in a subdirectory to keep things cleaner.

We've been watching a lot of movies lately. I saw American Pie, which was really funny, but also really hard to watch. Some of the scenes just make you cringe. I rented Iron Giant and ended up keeping it an extra night so I could watch it with Annie. It's amazing. What a great movie. It's really not a kid's movie, and besides, nothing tops a 100-foot-tall robot pretending to be Superman. I'm also going to see Supernova this weekend with my brother Sean. We both think it'll be fun, but just in case it sucks we want to go with someone we can taunt the movie with.

I'm broke again. I think it's my own fault, and not the bank's, but after new year's, I'm not sure. Either way, it means no buying a new coat or visiting Fry's until payday. sigh.

Before I went broke, though, I thought I had lots of money and bought the expansion pack for Half-Life, and it's great! It's almost as good a game as the original. I'm totally into it right now, and it's going to be hard to not neglect my schoolwork in favor of playing it.
