Well, as Scott said, Molli and I have finally arrived. After a brief fact-finding mission in Denver (conclusion: we love Denver), we have made it to Portland.

We are all in the same room in my parents' house, which is the same room I grew up in. What's odd about that is that much of the same furniture is still in the room, in the exact same places.

It's kind of tripping me out.

If I had the ability to ftp files, I'd post a few of Leilani (I'm at Dad's computer, so I have access to them all). If I can get my computer running, I'll put something up at my geocities account.

Until then . . . who knows. (Good luck with the server, Scott!)

Scott is right about one thing, though: Leilani is insanely cute.
