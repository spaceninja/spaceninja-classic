One of the originals, that is. Apple is set to announce a NEW iMac design come September, which will immediately render the old iMacs obsolete, and hopefully mean price drops . . . this could be good new for me, as I'm planning around october or so to drop money on either an older iMac or one of the original iBooks . . . one of the orange ones.
