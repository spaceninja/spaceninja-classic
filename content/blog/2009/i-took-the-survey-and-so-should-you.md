[![I took it, and so should you! The survey for people who make websites](/images/ala-survey.gif)](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/survey2009/)

If you haven't already, set aside ten minutes to fill out the [annual "State of the Web" survey](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/survey2009/) from A List Apart. This kind of data is important to gain an understanding of our community and profession, not just for ourselves, but the rest of the world.

> The data that you provide and we analyze is the only significant information about our profession as a profession to be published anywhere, by anyone. That makes it important.
