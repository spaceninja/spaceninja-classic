The map on the bunker wall. If you know what this is, you're already clicking through. If you don't, all I can say is that you need to watch last night's episode of _Lost_. via [Jeff Croft](http://jeffcroft.com/)'s [delicious links](http://del.icio.us/jcroft/lost) (here's the [original source](http://home.comcast.net/~towhateverend/LostWall.jpg))

**Edit:** Check out this [annotated version of the map](http://lost.cubit.net/pics/2x17/blastDoorMap.jpg), including translations of the Latin.
