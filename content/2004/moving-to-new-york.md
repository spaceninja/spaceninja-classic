Well, it's about time that I told all of you that I'm planning on moving to New York soon. The small-town atomosphere of Portland has been getting to me more and more, and I just think I would be happier in the Big Apple. The few days I spent there visiting Ryan were great fun, and it's clear to me that New York is the place for me.

Unfortunately, my boss can't afford the long-distance phone calls, so I'll have to quit my job, but I'm sure something will come along once I get out there. Maybe I can get Ryan's job as a doorman! April Fools!

Here are some other (much funnier) April Fool's joke sites that were put up today. If you find any others, let me know! Usually these sites are taken down the next day, so you should check them out while you have a chance.

- [Blizzard](http://blizzard.com/) announces that the "Two-headed Troll" will be a new race in its new online role-playing game Worlds of WarCraft. You will play one head, and another random player will control the other head.
- Bungie announces their new game project [Pimps at Sea](http://bungie.com/products/pimps/pimpsatsea.htm), where you will be able to import your favorite character from any other game and pimp them out on a pirate ship.
- Bungie announces [Halo 2 Sponsors](http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=/site/0/news/news_detail.html&id=6EC4B4C1-2A23-4C7C-9ABD-5EB46973A253). Product placement and ad revenue will be large sources of income from the new game, where the main character will wear Keds and drive a Chevy Van.
- [Maddox](http://maddox.xmission.com/) turns over a new leaf - his page has changed titles from "The Best Damn Page In the World" to "One Of The Better Pages In The Universe", and includes topics like "i love donald rumsfeld." and "lol @ fox for laugh out loud sundays!"
- I haven't watched it yet, but [Red Vs. Blue](http://www.redvsblue.com/) posted a video today claiming to summarize the plot so far, and tie up all the loose threads so they can quit making videos.
