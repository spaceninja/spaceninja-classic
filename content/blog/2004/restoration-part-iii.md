Alright! I haven't had a chance to made that more cheerful post yet, but it was for a good cause: I finally got off my butt and put up all the weblog sites I've been meaning to get online for the last couple weeks. Now you can enjoy the fresh stylings of:

- Sean's weblog at [nyarlo.net](http://nyarlo.net/)
- KT's weblog at [kt.spaceninja.com](http://kt.spaceninja.com/)
- David's family weblog at [dysnomia.spaceninja.com](http://dysnomia.spaceninja.com/)
- Leilani's photo/weblog at [leilani.spaceninja.com](http://leilani.spaceninja.com/blog/)

Now, there's still a bit of tidying up to do, some broken links to fix, some references to Rusted and Dysnomia sprinkled around the new sites, since I coped the templates, and obviously they all need their own designs - but they're online!

I figured better to have a website that's online and functional, even if it's not fully complete, than to have the websites be offline any longer.

Oh, and there may not be any new content on these for a few days, since the owners of these weblogs are probably hearing about it at the same time you are, but keep your eye on them, and you'll see more changes coming soon, and more quickly this time.

Next change in the pipe: Relocating Rusted to spaceninja.com - But there's a few details I need to work out first.
