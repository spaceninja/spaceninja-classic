Oh, the horror... I was throwing out a forgotten closetful of stuff at my parents' house, and I found my old D&D books. I cracked some open, hoping for one of those special moments that comes upon you when you find any especially cringe-inducing relic of the past. But no, they read just like any geek/technical website. There was the same deep lack of attitude, a blankness so familiar I didn't feel as distanced as I'd hoped. The horror. My prescription: more Japan, less [php.net.](http://php.net)

Now, the [Conan back issues](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3112868398/), on the other hand... heh. Bombast rules.
