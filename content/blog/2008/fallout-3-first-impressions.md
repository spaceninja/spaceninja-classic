I've only played for a few hours, and I've only made it a few hundred feet outside the Vault so far, but what I've seen, I like very much. The character creation system is clever, starting you out as a baby, and learning how to move around and interact with people. Eventually you take an aptitude test which helps determine which skills you start with. Most important though, is I think they nailed the feel of the original games. It feels a little strange bolted onto the Oblivion engine, but they've done a good job of adapting it to allow shooting. The shooting is not quite as fluid as a dedicated game like Halo, but it definitely works, and the addition of VATS for RPG-like targeting works well, and the results are often hilarious, just like the original games. I can't wait to play more.
