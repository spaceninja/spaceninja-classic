Annie has been planning this costume for a ridiculously long time, and the final result is adorable. I, for one, welcome our new octo-overlord.

On a side note, I know that I'm running late with Zoe's newsletter. But tonight I'm grumpy. Work has been kicking my ass lately, and knowing that I'm going to have to stay late tomorrow night to meet my deadline isn't helping. I'm having trouble snapping out of it and getting into the proper mindset for writing, so I'm not going to. Instead, I'm going to play video games and go to bed, and I'll just write her newsletter this weekend. In the meantime, enjoy the photos.
