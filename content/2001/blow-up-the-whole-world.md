Lately, when I sit in front of my computer, and I'm bored, I've been grabbing my copy of _Fight Club_ and flipping through it. Even after two readings and seeing the movie four times, it still amazes me.

> A layer of something thick and clear is collecting on top of the tallow in the fridge.
> 
> The tallow, I say, it's separating.
> 
> "Don't worry," Tyler says. "The clear layer on top is glycerin. You can mix the glycerin back in when you make soap. Or, you can skim the glycerin off."
> 
> Tyler licks his lips and turns my hands palm-down on his thigh, on the gummy flannel lap of his bathrobe.
> 
> "You can mix the glycerin with nitric acid to make nitroglycerin," Tyler says.
> 
> I breathe with my mouth open and say, nitroglycerin.
> 
> Tyler licks his lips wet and shining and kisses the back of my hand.
> 
> "You can mix the nitroglycerin with sodium nitrate and sawdust to make dynamite," Tyler says.
> 
> The kiss shines wet on the back of my white hand.
> 
> Dynamite, I say, and sit back on my heels.
> 
> Tyler pries the lid off the can of lye. "You can blow up bridges," Tyler says.
> 
> "You can mix the nitroglycerin with more nitric acid and paraffin and make gelatin explosives," Tyler says.
> 
> "You could blow up a building easy," Tyler says.
> 
> Tyler tilts the can of lye an inch above the shining wet kiss on the back of my hand.
> 
> "This is a chemical burn," Tyler says, "and it will hurt worse than you've ever been burned. Worse than a hundred cigarettes."
> 
> The kiss shines on the back of my hand.
> 
> "You'll have a scar," Tyler says.
> 
> "With enough soap," Tyler says, "you could blow up the whole world. Now remember your promise."
> 
> And Tyler pours the lye.
