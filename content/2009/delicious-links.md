Well, it looks like the script I use to post my delicious bookmarks here every week has broken. I'm working on fixing it, but this happens to coincide with me wondering lately if it makes sense to keep posting my links into my blog.

At first, the goal was that everything I did online was found here. But with the rise of Flickr and Twitter, that's become impractical. As a result, I've been toying with the idea of killing the automatic link posting, and instead pointing the "links" link up in the header to my Delicous Account.

So, what do you think? Do you prefer a blog that includes everything a person does online, so you only have to look in one place, or do you prefer when things are kept separate so you can just subscribe to the bits you're interested in?

Please leave a comment with your thoughts.
