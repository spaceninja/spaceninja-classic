Another funny story about people reacting to my sites:

I found out today that the Graphic Design head from Central Washington University was looking at [Space Ninja Design](http://spaceninja.com/site-archives/spaceninja/v2/) (long story) and the thing he was really impressed by was the "little fly that bounced around the screen in reaction to moving the mouse."

I have NO CLUE what this guy was talking about, and I heard the story third person, so I can't ask him. He's got a bit of a reputation as a hard-ass around the graphic design students (don't all graphic design teachers? I HATED mine!), which means he's not likely to be easily impressed by something dumb, or likely to be tricked by the mouse-rollovers I have on the site now.

I'm beginning to wonder whether there was actually a fly on his monitor.
