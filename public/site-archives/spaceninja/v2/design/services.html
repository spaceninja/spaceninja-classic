         <BR>Space Ninja Design's primary focus is on web design. We have been involved in site creation for years, and our experience can be seen in our results. We cover all areas of site creation, from planning to production, including graphics production and specialized coding.

         <P>Recently, we have expanded our focus to more than just web design. Our experience and talent in that field benefits us as we design computer games, applications and user interfaces.

         <P>Space Ninja believes that design and coding should be affordable. Our pricing is set at a reasonable rate that will cover our involvement, but will not gouge you for every cent.

         <P>Our employees are motivated, well-trained, and proud of the work they've accomplished. Space Ninja will stand behind anything it produces. We offer to perform free updates and fixes on minor issues for a month after the project is completed.

         <P>We admire clean, simple design as an effective means of communicating information. We strive to make our work easy to navigate. It should be clear to the user where they need to go to find what they are looking for.

         <P>We seek a seamless integration between design and code. Logical, structured layout in code is reflected in a sleek, clean interface, whether we're crafting a website or an application.

         <p>In short, Space Ninja Design will deliver on the promise of a top-quality product at an affordable price.
