oh my god!! i had the best time of my life tonight!!!!!!!!!!!  
  
first, let me tell you all about the pie. this was a benefit concert, and they were selling homemade pies. each band was supposed to get a pie all to itself (divided four ways gives us each a quarter of a pie - not bad eats for 20 minutes of playing!), but someone walked off with our pie during our set!  
  
  
can you believe it? someone walked off with our pie! a delicious mango-strawberry pie. well, we had to draw a line in the sand. one of the young women running the show said we could take another pie, so i relayed this to stefana. stefana in her infinite wisdom said, "if we were gypsies, we'd each have a pie to ourselves, maybe two by now." so i said, "well...why don't we have a pie then?" she said, "they hired gypsies! what do they expect?" a quick passing-off of the band pie, from my hands to hers, and pie #1 was safely in her car. (hee hee hee!) a few minutes later, band pie #2 was safely in my car.  
  
i tell you - pie can be sweet, but stolen pie is that much sweeter. mmmmm..stolen pie. (i also took as many bottles of sparkling mineral water as i could fit in my accordion case and pockets. what better to wash down the pie with!)  
  
  
but this was not the best part. this was just one of many wonderful things. i met a great group of klezmer musicians, including an accordionist who really is much, much better than me, but invited me to come and play with him anyway! i was also quite flattered when a kind old woman came up to me before the show (i'd been playing a little tune) and asked me if i give lessons! i told her no, i've only been playing for 3 months.. she didn't believe me! after our set, she found me again and said, "you were pulling my leg, saying you've only played for three months. i can tell." no! honest! it was very flattering (but really i've got a ways to go ;) ) thank you, eric and daniel, for coming to the show, too.. \*grinning\* it was great to see you there!  
  
  
eric and daniel left before the most fun experience in the world.. we square-danced! the last band of the night was a real authentic bluegrass ensemble with a real honest-to-God square-dance caller! i've never had such a good time. square-dancing is so much fun..holding hands with and swinging around pretty girls, listening to some wonderful tunes (including one of my all-time favorites, the old virginia reel!!), laughing and getting sweaty. it can't be beat.  
  
yep, the place really started to smell like a barn by the end ;)  
  
  
what a wonderful night. (think i'll have a slice of stolen pie!)
