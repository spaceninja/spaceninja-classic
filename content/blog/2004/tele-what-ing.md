\[phone rings\]

**Scott:** Hello?

\[woman on the other end of the phone sounds young\]

**RPA:** \[businesslike\] Hi, this is the Riverside Park Apartments calling. We're reviewing the application you sent us, and we were wondering if you've lined up employment in Washington.

**Scott:** Actually, I telecommute, so I'll be keeping my current job.

**RPA:** ...I don't understand. Will you be driving back to Oregon every day?

**Scott:** No, I tele - I'm sorry, have you not heard the term telecommuting before?

**RPA:** \[relieved\] Um, no...

**Scott:** Sorry about that, it's common in my line of work. It means I'll be working from home on my computer.

**RPA:** \[nervous\] ...Oh... Um, do you have any proof of that?

**Scott:** What kind of proof are you looking for? I already sent you my paystubs.

**RPA:** Do you have a letter of hire?

**Scott:** A letter of hire? I was hired like three years ago.

**RPA:** Well, we need some kind of proof that you'll be working.

**Scott:** I'm not sure what you're looking for. Do you want to talk to my boss?

**RPA:** If you could have your boss just type up a letter stating that you'll be "working from home" and how much you make per month, and then sign that and fax it over, we could send that to the screening company.

**Scott:** Okay, I make an hourly wage, but that sounds fine, I'll call my boss right now and have him fax that over.

**RPA:** Great, thank you.

**Scott:** Okay, bye.

_Note: this phone call comes after I've already submitted the lengthy application, which asks for our previous three residences, our last two jobs (plus contact information), our checking account, car insurance, car loans, and our tacit approval of a credit check. Is it just me or has getting an apartment become a LOT more difficult lately?_
