I am _extremely_ excited for two reasons. One is geeky, and the other is actually really cool.

The first (and geeky) reason is that my new computer game, [Black & White](http://www.lionhead.co.uk/shocked/bw/index.html), paid for with my first paycheck from my new jobs, will be here by the end of the week!

The second reason is that [Dr. Drew](http://www.drdrew.com/), from the radio/TV show [LoveLine](http://www.kroq.com/loveline/loveline.html), is coming to CWU for some sort of lecture this term. Jill the News Producer at the radio station managed to talk him into doing an interview with us. Guess who gets to do the interview? That's right, I get to meet Dr. Drew. ...oh, and Annie will be there too.
