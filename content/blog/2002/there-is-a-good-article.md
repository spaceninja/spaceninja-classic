There is a good article up about [what would happen **AFTER** a war with Iraq](http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/11/fallows.htm). The author makes the point that if we went to war, we need to be prepared for the regime change that would follow a victory, and that means years of US support, to the point where Iraq would, for all intents and purposes, be another US territory, only much harder to manage. Suprisingly, the author also has a sense of humor.

> "The in-and-out model has obviously become unrealistic. If Saddam Hussein could be destroyed by a death ray or captured by a ninja squad that sneaked into Baghdad and spirited him away, the United States might plausibly call the job done. It would still have to wonder what Iraq's next leader might do with the weapons laboratories, but the immediate problem would be solved."
