So, I came home last night and worked on Filterchrist. Aww YEAH.  
  
It now has 6 different granular filters, which are unappetizing when heard in the raw... But when you modulate and mix the granular sounds with the originals, it opens up a gorgeous sonic dimension that I've never heard anywhere else.  
  
One of the classic synthesis techniques is called 'frequency modulation', aka 'FM', like FM radio. Ever played Marble Madness, or Gauntlet, or the other classic Atari games? Practically every sound effect in those games is FM. It often has a distinctive metallic sound, like a bell. But it can also be used to make fat bass sounds, and is quite versatile once you start playing with it.  
  
Last night I discovered that when you take sound files, and FM them with my granular sounds, the results are _beautiful_. Imagine soft, morning-fog versions of your sound files, a little metallic with some phantom pitches and tones, but with the harsh metallic edge taken off. Sooooo good.  
  
Also I found a few ways to make synthetic drums sound more organic and natural. Super-yum.

Okay, that's enough of that... :)  
  
Meanwhile, I applied at another print shop yesterday, and I think I'm a shoe-in for this position.  
  
Woman Screening Me: "...And you know all the software we use! And with your printing experience, wow... You're practically overqualified for this job!"  
Me: \*CHOKE\* "Don't say that!!!"  
  
Fingers crossed...
