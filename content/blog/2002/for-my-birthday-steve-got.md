For my birthday, Steve got me the **Old Mr. Boston _De Luxe_ Official Bartender's Guide**. It's a basic recipe book for mixed drinks that has been reprinted almost every year since 1935. It's full of funny little passages, like this one from the introduction, titled "An Introduction to the Art of Good Mixing and Good Living."

> "Old Mr. Boston will appear frequently throughout the pages of this book. He is a rare and versatile gentleman, everlastingly young and ever ready to accept the difficult role of host. Follow the advice of this joyful and genial friend and there will be many pleasant times in store for you. We know you are going to like Old Mr. Boston."

Now I just need to get a larger selection of alcohol, and we can start testing some of these drinks out! In the meantime, I think I'll read the kick-ass comics that Miles got me and watch the special edition DVD of Evil Dead (with the sculpted cover designed to look like the necronomicon from the movie) that Annie got me!
