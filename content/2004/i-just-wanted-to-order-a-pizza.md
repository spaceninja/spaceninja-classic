Whoo! It's a good link day!

Check out [But All I Wanted Was A Pizza!](http://www.aclu.org/pizza/images/screen.swf "screen.swf (application/x-shockwave-flash Object)") - A great flash movie about the dangers of the loss of privacy. (via [Angie McKaig](http://www.angiemckaig.com/archives/2004/10/07/assorted_sweets_20041007/index.html))

Also be sure to read [An Open Letter To A Local Radio Station](http://www.poundy.com/2004_10_01_blogarchives.html#109717417841316453), from Poundy.
