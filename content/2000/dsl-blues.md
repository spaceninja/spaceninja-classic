Ellensburg, the town to which I am moving in three weeks has DSL service. This is a good thing. I am a web designer, and I spend a good chunk of time at my computer online. A dial-up is no longer a realistic option for me. So hearing that DSL exists in Ellensburg was a good thing.

The DSL service is limited to within three miles of the phone company's building. This apparently doesn't cover anywhere near campus, which is where Annie wants to live. I was unaware that Ellensburg was even three miles in diameter, but it apparently is. That or the phone company is 2.9 miles outside of town, as Miles pointed out to me.

So now my options are to move closer to campus and pray that the cable company starts offering cable modems, or move into "downtown" E-burg and get a DSL line. I will be in town for two years, so this decision will affect me. This decision will have to wait until we actually go to town and I can see just how far away the phone company is. If I'm lucky, the three mile perimeter is still within walking distance of campus, though maybe not on the side that Annie wants.

I cannot work via a dialup connection for two years!
