<big>Dr. Colossus Must Die! - Arrakis Records</big>

<P>Dr. Colossus Must Die was released in June 1997 on Arrakis Records.  This album was created with the new band member, Amy Johnson.  She filled in Melissa's spot admirably, providing the band with creative and original instrumental samples, as well as a female vocalist.  This album met with less intrigue than the last, but also with less backlash and protestation from church groups, PTA groups, animal activism groups, and child labor groups.  The band's sound in this album takes a definite turn towards louder, electronic industrial type music, leaving pop behind.  This change had been happening slowly over the last few albums, but was now distinct and unmistakable.  Big Ed was quoted as saying (while drunk): "I see our music as a pop music brownie with industrial sprinkles, heading towards an industrial brownie with pop music sprinkles... but of course, we would never label our music."  Colossus replied "Who the hell is Big Ed?"

<P>The album contains an original Yellow Number Five song, in addition to the usual covers.  Low Self Esteem is written by Dr. Colossus, and produced by Yellow Number 5.  This album is widely available.
