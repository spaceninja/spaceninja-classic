If you've seen the trailer, then you've already got a taste of it, but basically this is a live-action cartoon. The visual effects and the super-saturated colors aren't just in the racing scenes - the whole movie looks like a photoshop layout. To be honest, it kind of bothered me at first. Thankfully, the story and acting is good enough that I quickly stopped caring. The movie is peppered with references to the cartoon, and it's genuinely funny. The cast is excellent, and while they're a bit one-dimensional, they're pretty direct copies of their cartoon characters, so it's to be expected. John Goodman especially stole the show for me - his character is great, always harrumphing and grunting around. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is excellent, and it **almost** redeems the Wachowski Brothers for the Matrix sequels.
