I had a great weekend! Zach, Eric, Zima and Sean came over on Friday night to watch _Reservoir Dogs_. I'd forgotten how much I love that movie. The DVD comes with a bunch of extra stuff like some lame deleted scenes, and "KBILLY's radio", which lets you listen to some random audio stuff related to the movie, including an interview with a convicted driver for a heist team, describing what he liked and didn't like about the movie.

While I was talking to Miles about it, we got to talking about caper and heist movies and I mentioned that I didn't think was really possibly to make a bad heist movie, and Miles said he's take me up on the challenge. It'll be interesting to see if he can do it, taking it seriously. If he just makes an hour of random unrelated stuff, I don't think that would qualify. He has to actually \*try\* to make a heist flick.

On Saturday, Annie's brother Zach arrived to spend the weekend with us. We got some burritos and hung out during the day until everyone came over to play Settlers of Catan. Afterwards, we rented a copy of _Donny Darko_, which several people hadn't seen. That movie is incredible.

And Sunday was amazingly lazy. It was great. We slept in, and then watched TV and played video games for most of the day. That night we went to a local Italian restaurant for dinner, and then went to see Steve's band play at the pub, which was excellent.

Nothing to say about today, though. I'm just working. So you should all go read this entry from [Visigoth's journal](http://visigoth.killingmachines.org/single.php?id=74230).
