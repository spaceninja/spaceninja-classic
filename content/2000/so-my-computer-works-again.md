So my computer works again! For the first time in nearly two weeks, I'm doing internet stuff on _my_ computer instead of Annie's! Hooray! How did I do it? Well, I'm glad you asked. First I yanked the damn sound card right out of the box, and the I formatted the hard drive and reinstalled with Win2K. Now I have no sound capabilities, but my computer functions without crashing. Truly, it is smooth and deadly.

In addition, my most excellent buddy Jester heard about my job plight here in Eburg and volunteered to recommend me to a few people! It might not yield anything, but if it does, I'll get some web design work! WooHoo!
