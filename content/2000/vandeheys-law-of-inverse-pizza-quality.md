**The higher the quality of the pizza when warm, the lower the quality of the pizza when cold.**

e.g., Domino's pizza is not very good when warm, but tastes pretty good after sitting in the refrigerator overnight. Gourmet pizza, on the other hand, tastes awesome warm, but is really horrible when cold.
