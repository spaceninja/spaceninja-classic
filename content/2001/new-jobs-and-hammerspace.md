Jill has asked me to watch Gavin (her 1-year old son) a couple days a week, for which she will pay me. This is cool, because we already watch Gavin frequently, so it doesn't really feel like extra work. Also, Jill is the News Director at the radio station, and her News Producer recently graduated, so she needs someone to fill that spot on a very part-time basis (like six hours a week). But it's a paid position, and she asked me to do it! (for those who don't know, producer is not as impressive as it sounds in radio... it means literally the person who does the production... I'm the grunt labor). As with Gavin, I go in and help with the news now and then already, so both of these feel like a little extra money for doing something I don't mind at all!

Also, I _finally_ got off my ass and posted a new [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) comic. The way Annie and I looked in the comic has been bugging me for awhile, so I fixed them. Well, I fixed Annie. I found out that there's no good way to draw a beard on a hammerspace character so I quit trying and just redid my character without it, which I think works better than the freakishly overextended jaw it had before. But the reason this is exciting is because, as dumb as it sounds, I wasn't into doing hammerspace because those two characters were bugging me. Now that I got their appearance nailed, I'm hoping to start doing new comics much more regularly... at least once a week, and hopefully more frequently than that. So keep an eye on it!
