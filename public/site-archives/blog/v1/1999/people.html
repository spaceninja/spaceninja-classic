<BR>Annie: A note for unaware readers:
<BR>In case you have no idea who I am or who Annie is, and you just stumbled into this document by accident, Annie is my girlfriend. I met her at a party her older brother threw, that I was attending because he and I were good friends. We hit it off really well. I don't know if I believed in love at first sight before, but SOMETHING sure happened that night. It was really strange. We just clicked. I could see it in her eyes, and things just started going. We were inseperable the whole night, and ever since then, for that matter. I don't think I've ever been happier than the time I've known her, or felt more connected to a person than I do to her. I truly think she's my soulmate.

<P>Hmm... I guess I should add something about other people in my life too...

<P>Aaron: My Roommate:
<BR>We've known each other since high school, and have always been friends, it seems. We joked about moving in together back then, which is why it's so strange that we actually did. We're really different people, I've discovered, but enough fundamental beliefs are the same that we can survive together with our friendship intact.

<P>KT: My Best Friend:
<BR>I don't even know where to begin describing my friendship with KT. It's ranged all over the map. We've gone from being acquantances to being really close friends, swung dangerously close to me asking her out once, and after all the dust settled we somehow came out closer than ever, as best friends. I value her opinion, and respect her more than almost anyone else.

<P>Annie and I were talking the other night, and she asked me if I considered her my best friend, and I wasn't sure how to answer. I'm still not sure how to answer. My immediate reaction is to say KT. KT is, in my mind, the definition of a best friend. Aaron and Annie are also my best friends, but their friendships are not what I would define as a best friend. In Annie's case, it's much more than that, and in Aaron's case, it's just different. It's equal, but I'm not sure how to define it. Annie's my soulmate. Aaron's my roommate, and KT is my best friend. Maybe that doesn't express it fully, and maybe it's categorizing things that aren't meant to be categorized, but that's the best I can do right now. You'll have to take it.

<P>There are other people in my life too... There's Dave, who's friendship has been strengthened lately due to my dating his sister, I'm around him all the time, so we have the chance to be friends again. There's Steve, an old friend from high school. Steve is a complete asshole at times, and at other times, he's one of my favorite people to be around, because when I'm around Steve, I have FUN. Steve is one of those people who refuses to be categorized, so I'm not going to waste my time doing so. There's Colin, who I see every now and then to play war games. There's my pen pal, Khrynn. And, of course, there's Jester... The Yang to my Yang, as he so eloquently put it. Jester is on my wavelength when it comes to humor. We don't always have much in common in the rest of our lives, but we understand each other perfectly when it comes to humor... He has an excellent description of the two of us sharing a joke on his <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/~achtermn/quill/122798.html">website</A>...
