Find a broken computer somewhere. Find a pickaxe, a few friends and a camera. Destroy the computer with your friends and record the events on camera. The camera is so you can look back on the photo fondly and smile at the memories of good times had by all.

There is a photo I have of Steve and another guy we knew in high school going at a computer with a pickaxe. Steve called me up and said "I'm going to destroy a computer, would you like to take pictures?"

An hour later, we had a full roll of film and a video shot of Steve and the other guy destroying a monitor, an old 8086 and one of those old macs that were self-contained in the monitor.

Everyone enjoyed it, and even though Steve's family made him patch the dents he put in the driveway with the pickaxe, I think we would all agree it was not only worthwhile, it was one the defining moments of our youth.

If you find yourself growing frustrated with computer culture, I recommend that you proceed with this course of action, and then hang a photo of the event next to your computer. This will keep you from retaining frustration towards your computer, and keep you from taking it too seriously. How can you take anything seriously that you once destroyed with a pickaxe?

I truly believe that it was this event that turned Steve and I into the handsome, charming men we are today, the envy of all other men.
