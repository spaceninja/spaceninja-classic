The decrease in activity at work, which I had hoped would correspond with an increase of activity here on my blog, instead corresponded with a dramatic rise in germs.

Last week there was a minor pink eye outbreak in the creative department, which resulted in an almost comical proliferation of anti-bacterial hand soap dispensers around the office, as everyone scrambled to avoid it.

Then on Thursday night, Zoe started throwing up. It turns out she had a stomach flu that she caught at one of her groups, after which several of her friends got sick, too. Naturally, it spread to Annie, and then to me. I was fine on Friday, when Annie first started getting an upset tummy, and the whole thing cumulated with me puking my guts up Sunday afternoon (for the first time since college). Annie got lucky and never got worse than nauseous, but it made the jump to Sean, who was up and down all Sunday night getting sick.

On Monday, I felt fine, so I went to work, after warning my coworkers to keep washing their hands, and I hoped that would be the end of it. Unfortunately, Zoe caught a cold while recovering from the flu, which means Annie has a cold, too.

I stayed home from work yesterday to take care of them, and now I have it, too. So I'm home sick again, and about to go take a nap. Hopefully, this weekend will let us all get healthy again, because A) I can't afford to take any more time off from work, and B) Zoe's birthday party is next weekend.
