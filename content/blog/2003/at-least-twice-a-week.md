At least twice a week, Annie and I have everyone over to our house. Wednesday is movie night (it started as Miyazaki night, and soon it'll be turning into Kung-Fu night), and Saturday is Secret Project Saturday. Of course, we've really only done one secret project, but everyone's itching to do another one. I'd give you the details, but then I'd have to kill you. Also, I don't really know any details.

A big part of these get-togethers is dinner. When Annie and I were in Ellensburg, our friend Jill had everyone over and made dinner at least once a week, and it was excellent. So we tried to carry on the tradition here in Portland. It worked out really well, but this last month everyone was hit with food apathy. We didn't have a lot in the pantry, and no one felt very creative. We ate a lot of pizza.

So this month, we picked up a ton of groceries, and we've got the materials to make some excellent meals... here's a short list for you to drool over:

- Reuben Sandwiches (Pastrami and Sourkraut on Rye with Thousand Island Dressing - cheese optional)
- Cassarole - A recipie from my mom, with tons of yummy stuff in it. I've never made this before, so it'll be an experiment.
- Meatloaf - Annie found a good recipie for a Turkey meatloaf. I know, it sounds disgusting, but she made it the other night, and it's actually really tasty!
- Lasagne - Made without Feta or Ricotta cheese, both of which I hate. This version is made with Cheddar/Parmesian/Mozzarella/Jack cheeses and like four pounds of beef.
- Boboli - we picked up some bobolis, so one night we can make our own pizzas... spinich and garlic on one... tomatoes on the other?
- Chicken & Rice - basically, you throw a bunch of white rice, chicken breasts, and cream of celery/mushroom soup into a cassarole dish and bake it, so everything absorbs all the flavor. Very tasty.
