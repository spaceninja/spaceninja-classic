[![Eric Meyer on CSS](/images/298401111_9e2c942bca_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298401111/)[Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/), known in the web community as the Godfather of CSS, has written several more technical books about CSS for O'Reilly, but this book, as well as its sequel, are intended as a more practical, hands-on set of tutorials. In both books, he presents a series of common scenarios such as adding a calendar to a web page, or styling a press release, and walks you through how to use CSS to apply a design to them. While this is informative, it's not really very useful. Once you read this book once, you'll likely never refer to it again, and if you've been at this awhile (or have visited [Eric's site](http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/) before), you've probably already seen most of the techniques used. If you're interested in seeing how a master practices his craft, I would recommend checking the book out from the library - but at nearly $50, I would recommend spending that money on a book that you'll get more use out of in the future, such as Bulletproof Web Design. (_If this book were a college course, it would be 200 level._)
