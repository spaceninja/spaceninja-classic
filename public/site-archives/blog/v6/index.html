		<p>Yes! The guys who were working on the <a href="#"><em>Sam &amp; Max</em></a> sequel formed their own company and aquired the rights to make new games! It’s actually by the same company that’s making the <a href="#"><em>Bone</em></a> game, so I’ve got high hopes!

<div class="content">
		<ol>
	<li>“Stuck in the Middle With You,” Stealers Wheel - <em>Reservoir Dogs</em><br>
Annie hates it when I play this song. How can anyone who saw this movie <strong>not</strong> think of a cop tied to a chair getting his ear cut off when this song plays? It helps that the lyrics are oddly appropriate.</li>
	<li>“Where is My Mind,” Pixies - <em>Fight Club</em><br>
I’m sure this doesn’t qualify for people who had listened to any Pixies songs before <em>Fight Club</em>,
but that was the first time for me, so “Where is My Mind” is forever
branded with the images of Jack and Marla watching office buildings
collapse.</li>
	<li>“Golgatha Tenement Blues,” Machines of Loving Grace - <em>The Crow</em><br>
Really, anything on the first soundtrack qualifies, but especially this
track, since it was early enough in the CD that I heard it all the
time, but it was by a band I’m not very familiar with, so I don’t know
any of their work outside of the context. I always picture Brandon Lee
running along rooftops to this song.</li>
	<li>“Halcyon &amp; On &amp; On,” Orbital - <em>Hackers</em><br>
I had probably heard the song once or twice before I saw <em>Hackers</em>,
but it was used to perfection in that movie, during the flyover of the
digital city. To this day, I can’t hear this song without getting a
desire to open up a terminal window and start dorking around on a Unix
system.</li>
	<li>“Dry The Rain,” The Beta Band - <em>High Fidelity</em><br>
“I will now sell five copies of <em>The Three E.P.s</em>
by the Beta Band.” And they played the finale to the song, and everyone
in the store is nodding their heads. Annie and I both love this song,
and playing it gives me the feeling that I’m in a warm friendly
neighborhood music store.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Ground Rules</strong><br>
What I’m talking about here is songs that you can’t hear without
thinking of the movie that you first heard the song in. In your head,
the scene from the movie and the song are permanently linked, for
better or worse. The obvious example is “Also Spake Zarathustra” from <em>2001</em>. There are some exceptions, however. <strong>No Musicals:</strong> Songs used in musicals like <em>The Blues Brothers</em> or <em>Evita</em>
are exempt because it’s not clever usage of a well-chosen song by the
director to nail the scene, it a scene written around the song. <strong>No Songs Written For The Movie:</strong> Obviously, if the song was written specifically for the movie, like “The Crying Game,” it’s exempt. And lastly, <strong>No Theme Songs:</strong>
You can’t say that the “Theme From Mortal Kombat” always makes you
think of Mortal Kombat - it was designed to do so. Now, let’s make this
an audience participation sport! Everyone leave a comment with your top
five!</p>

<div class="content">
		<p><a href="#"><img src="index_files/work-in-progress2.jpg" class="photo" alt="photoshop mockup" width="450"></a></p>
	<p>Work is continuing on the new design for the blog. I’ve moved on from <a href="#">thumbnailing</a>
to making mockups in Photoshop. I had a few false starts, and
entertained a few odd ideas at first, but I soon got my focus back and
worked hard at producing the mockup based on the final thumbnail I
chose. Oddly, while my thumbnail was very helpful at getting sizes and
layout down, I hadn’t put much thought into uses of color, beyond that
I wanted to use more color than normal. In the end, my color choice was
dictated by the photo in my header graphic, and I’m planning on setting
it up so that I can easily slap up a new header graphic and adjust the
colors on the rest of the design to match, which would let me do
special designs or seasonal colors if I wanted to.</p>
	<p>I also
found myself debating about what size to make the design. I spent quite
awhile looking at other blogs, evaluating whether or not I liked how
their design filled the browser window. What I discovered is that while
it’s quite trendy right now to design for <kbd>1024px screens</kbd> and set the
design up to cut off gracefully on an <code>800px screen</code> (or not), I don’t
think it’ll work for me. It’s great for guys like <a href="#">A List Apart</a>,
who have an abundance of content that all needs to fit on the front
page, but my personal site doesn’t really need that. I would prefer
that the design follow function in this case, so I’m sticking to 750px
width. That’s actually a step up from the current design, but I’ve
already used this width on <a href="#">Sean’s blog</a>, and I like the extra breathing room it gives, especially in the sidebar.</p>
	<p>I’m pushing myself right now to finish the design in time to submit my site for <a href="#">round 3 of admissions</a> to the <a href="#">9rules network</a>.
It will definitely be a big task to get everything done in time,
especially since this weekend Annie and I are watching our friends’
kids so they can go on a date. Wish me luck!

		<p>Even the Vatican thinks that <a href="#">intelligent design is dumb</a>.</p>
	<blockquote><p>“The
fundamentalists want to give a scientific meaning to words that had no
scientific aim,” he said at a Vatican press conference. He said the
real message in Genesis was that “the universe didn’t make itself and
had a creator”.</p>
	<p>This idea was part of theology, Cardinal
Poupard emphasised, while the precise details of how creation and the
development of the species came about belonged to a different realm -
science. Cardinal Poupard said that it was important for Catholic
believers to know how science saw things so as to “understand things
better”.</p></blockquote>
