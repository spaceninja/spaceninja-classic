I just got a volunteer job as the Web Coordinator for BRO, Basic Rights Oregon. Sweet, it looks to be a good resume piece. And man, does their site ever need work. [http://www.basicrights.org](http://www.basicrights.org)

Did I mention that it's trippy being the only straight person in the building? See, BRO has gathered to fight the evil forces of the Oregon Citizen's Alliance which, zombie-like, has risen from is five-year hibernation to put yet more crazed, constitution-violating anti-gay measures on the ballot. Allow me to illustrate with these hand puppets:

In other news, Miles' PowerMac 7200 continues its long descent towards "music box" status, as the owner discovers he can fit 11 albums worth of mp3s onto a single CD.
