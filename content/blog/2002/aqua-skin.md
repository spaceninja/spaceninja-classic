I finally finished my Max OSX style skin! Head over to the options page and select "Aqua" from the drop down menu.

There's only one catch. It won't work right under Internet Explorer on a PC. Microsoft has this stupid bug involving transparent .png files, so it'll look really weird on there. However, if you're using [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) or IE on a Mac, you're good to go!
