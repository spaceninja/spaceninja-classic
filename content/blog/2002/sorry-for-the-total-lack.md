Sorry for the total lack of posts. Annie and I went to Tacoma for the weekend, and we had such a great time with Dave and Rose that they came down to Portland to stay with us for a few days. They just went home this afternoon, but now it's too hot to think about posting much more than a summary.

1. We took Sean to a bar last night and got him a Long Island Ice Tea (Sean's reaction: "It's nice").
2. We picked up the [entertainment center](http://www.ikea-usa.com/product_presentation/show.asp?productnumber=00014279&type=III&id=471) from Ikea that we'd been wanting.
3. We decided that we liked having Lola, Dave and Rose's puppy, around so much that we're definitely going to get a cat at some point.

Anyways, I'll write more interesting things once the temperature in my computer room has dropped below 95 degrees.
