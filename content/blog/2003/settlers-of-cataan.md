Since secret projects seem to be lacking lately, I've been looking for other ways to liven up our get togethers lately. One thing I've been wanting to do for awhile was to institute a fairly regular board game night, perhaps once a month or so. We got our start last week when I asked Daniel to bring over his family's copy of The Settlers of Catan, which I was turned onto by [Pat](http://journal.toddsville.com/). I was pretty sure I was going to like it, but I wasn't sure how big a hit it would be, and when Daniel and I described the game to Eric and Miles, we got mixed reactions. However, everyone agreed to give it a shot, although Eric said he would probably have to leave within the hour, so he wouldn't be able to play the whole game. Well, a few minutes into the game (which ended up being between Daniel, myself, Sean, Annie, Miles and Eric), we could tell that this game was amazing. Eric ended up staying until the game ended, which was several hours later (due to how slowly all of us newbies were playing). But basically, the game rules.

Annie's got a contact at the game store in the mall, so we won't have to pay the full $40 price, but we still might not be able to pick up a copy for awhile. And the expansion pack (which allows more than four players) might be awhile after that. In the meantime, I've been amusing myself against the [online java version](http://catan.cs.nwu.edu/), which isn't a good, but is better than not playing at all. If any of you want to play against me online, let me know, and we'll set a match up.
