The phone rang at 7:30am. After a few seconds of cheerful greetings from this guy who thinks I'm someone else, it comes out that he's looking for Mitch... but he has the correct phone number. Knowing college towns, I suggest that the person he's looking for probably moved out and we were assigned his old phone number. This is when he reveals to me that Mitch runs a contracting company and posted MY phone number in "the Contractor's Handbook," which is where he got it from. The caller apologized, and warned me that I would probably be getting quite a few more calls.

Oh goody.
