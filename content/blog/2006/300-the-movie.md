Production on [the movie adaptation of Frank Miller's _300_](http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/) is underway, and the website has up comparison shots between Miller's artwork and the composite film footage. It looks like (visually, at least) they're working just as hard as on _Sin City_ to keep things accurate to the comic. I don't recognize any of the names in the [IMDB listing](http://imdb.com/title/tt0416449/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9MzAwfGZ0PTF8bXg9MjB8bG09NTAwfGNvPTF8aHRtbD0xfG5tPTE_;fc=1;ft=29;fm=1), but I'm sure Sean will know more than me.

If you haven't read the comic, it's based on the story of the 300 Spartans who single-handedly defended the mountain pass against the Persians in the [Battle of Thermopylae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae), and it's an incredibly epic story. I'm definitely looking forward to this one.
