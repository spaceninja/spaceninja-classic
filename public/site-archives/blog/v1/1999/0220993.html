2.20.99.3am
<BR>Strange day. Good day, but strange. It started out normally enough, went to class, went to work, went to meeting for work, got some stuff done, and then picked up KT for bad movie night. My boss hosts movie night for our team at work. It's once a week, and he managed to get access to one of the movie rooms at PSU for us to use. It has a DVD player, he has a large collection of DVDs, it's a good match. The whole time he's been hosting these, I've wanted to host the bad movie night. VHS, not DVD, and show Barbarella and Dolemite, which are both truly horrible movies. I love them both. The first time I saw Dolemite, I had to walk out after a half-hour. It get easier, though, I sat through the entire film tonight. KT stayed for Barbarella, which I've made her watch before, and she likes, but left before Dolemite, which was probably just as well, since the rest of us were getting pretty loud (you can't really stay quiet through a movie like Dolemite). We created a drinking game where you take a shot of whatever you have every time you see the microphone on screen. You would be piss-drunk after 20 minutes. The alternate version is every time Dolemite says M-F, you take a shot. You wouldn't be as drunk after 20 minutes, but by the end of the movie you'd be nicely plastered. When the movies ended, we all headed over to the Tek Team room, at about midnight. Naturally, there were still about three guys in there playing games and some actually working. We were loud and yelling quotes from the movies (me: "WRECHED GIRL! HAVE YOU NO SHAME??" steve: "THE EARTH HAS LOST ITS LAST GREAT DICTATOR! I, THE INVENTOR OF THE POSITRONIC RAY!!! AAAARGH!!!!!!" miles: "Dolemite's my name, and fuckin' cats up's my game!" tek guys: look up in bewilderment and blink a lot (tek guys always blink a lot... it has to do with staring at a monitor all day every day)). I think we irritated the people, and I think I may have accidentally convinced Shem (the tek's boss) that I was going to pirate all their software... he kept giving me this look and I felt guilty later and made Steve promise to tell Shem I was all talk. Then we all went our separate ways, and as I walked to Safeway at 12:30 to get some change for laundry and buy a vitamin-C packed liquid of some sort, I started getting that same good feeling you get after a good party. It was quiet and mellow and I was wide-awake and had no interest in going to bed. Luckily I didn't have to. On the way I saw a raccoon. I know this is no big deal in the city, but it seemed cool to me. I stood there really quiet, and the raccoon and I regarded each other for a few minutes before he shuffled off into a bush, shooting me suspicious little glances the whole way. That's about it. I couldn't tell you why it seems strange. I guess it's just been awhile since I've had that "going home from a good party" feeling. I like it.
