Player sprite has a giant leaf-blower type implement which s/he can aim in any direction. By aiming down, can propel self through the air. By aiming at enemy sprites, can launch them into lava pits, etc, or just send them away.

But watch out! The blower is a double edged... blower... For it also propels the player character backwards. Hence we get a type of gameplay where the player tries to find immobile objects to brace him or herself against before attacking.

There would also be suction mode, for pulling in power-ups, etc.

(Does anybody else miss MegaMan?)
