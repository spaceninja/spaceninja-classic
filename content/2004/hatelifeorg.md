Hatelife.org returns!! Sort of.

For what it's worth, anyone who wants to can download their old hatelife journal here: [http://hate.yurusan.com/](http://hate.yurusan.com/)

You can also download forums.

I don't know if the old hatelife.org domain name will ever be given into my hands, so I decided to put this up for now. Nothing lasts forever, but considering that some people spent years putting their words into this database, I feel like they should be able to get them back out.

**June 5, 2005 Followup:** Yurusan.com is offline, and the hatelife archive is not currently available anywhere online. Nor does it seem likely that the hatelife.org domain will ever be handed off to new management. For now, it looks like the old hatelife is gone for good. Interested parties should check out the "new" hatelife, set up by fans of the old site. It's a pretty accurate recreation of the original. You can find it at [hatelife.net](http://www.hatelife.net/).
