[![Holiday Edition](/images/319352827_6473ef59e1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/319352827/)

Over the weekend, I upgraded the theme for Space Ninja. Firstly, I changed the header and footer color scheme and pattern for the holidays. I think it's nice, and the little sprig of mistletoe over the logo cracks me up.

Secondly, I upgraded the site to "widescreen" format - which really just means that I'm targeting 1024px screen resolutions instead of 800px. Now that 95% of the viewing population is on the larger screen, I can upgrade to two sidebars, which is good, since it was getting pretty lengthy with just the one. Now the delicious links are near the top, but don't interfere with the blog functionality like recent comments.

The other cool thing that widescreen format gives me is the ability to post larger photos. The previous design only let me post 450px wide photos, which causes problems for me, since flickr only offers photos at 500px and 250px. This new design is specifically formatted for 500px wide photos, which means that I should be able to post more photos in the future, and will make life easier once Zoe is born.

Speaking of Zoe, you'll notice that there's (still) no mention of her in the redesign. That's coming soon, too. In the meantime, if you're looking for baby information, head over to [baby.spaceninja.com](http://baby.spaceninja.com/), where you'll find my information program running. Annie's convinced the math I'm using is faulty, so that will be revisited soon, as well as adding other content to the page.

Not many changes under the hood other than that, though. I did some minor cleanup in the markup and CSS, but left things largely intact, since this upgrade was focused on widescreen. I may revisit this at some point, though, and get the code a little neater.

If you're using IE6, it probably looks horrible. I haven't had a chance to test for it yet, since I'm running IE7 at home, and haven't installed the VirtualPC image yet. Sometime in the next week or two, I'll get IE6 compatibility working, but in the meantime, I'll just encourage you to check out the site in Firefox or IE7.
