in the most curious twist of fate yet, my freelance people said today that i could start working with them full-time not in mid-summer like we talked, but as early as the next week or two.  
  
i never would've seen this coming. \[tangent: the pay is substantial.\]  
  
  
\[aside: traffic is pretty slow on killingmachines lately.\]
