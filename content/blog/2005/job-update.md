My old boss called me up the other day and offered me a job. He's working for a startup in town, and thought I would work well for a position they needed to fill. I ended up turning it down, because it turned out to be tech support for a company that writes route management software for waste management companies. That means that not only would I not be doing web production, I would be working phones and taking calls from garbagemen who are having trouble doing their job because of a computer in the truck. The money was decent, but the situation was too far from what I'm looking for.

It feels really strange to turn down work, but the whole point of leaving Seattle was to find a job where I would be happier at and fit in better.

On the flip side of that coin, there's Aquent, the placement agency I've been working with. They've been looking for full-time work for me, and in the meantime, they've been keeping me working with odd temp jobs. It's been surprisingly easy, and I've found that I'm enjoying the work. And the contractor rates I'm pulling in are nice, too.

I don't want to talk about it yet, for fear of jinxing it, but there's a chance the temp job I'm working right now could turn into something more.

Plus, I've got an interview with DEQ on Wednesday. State jobs might not be the most exciting, but they're very stable and have great benefits.

Anyways, keep your fingers crossed for me!
