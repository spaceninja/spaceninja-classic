> Distraction seems to be our current favorite parenting tool. "Can you imagine," my friend Kathy, also a mother of a two-year-old, once asked me, "if you and Michael were fighting and you were furious and in tears, but he was just like, 'Mmm. I know. That's too bad. Hey, honey, look at the blue jay! Do you see the _blue jay?!_ Do you want some _raisins?_ Here, have a raisin.'" \-- Catherine Newman, Waiting for Birdy
