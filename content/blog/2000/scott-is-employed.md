Hooray! I had an interview yesterday at ShirtWorks, a local t-shirt printing shop. They've been trying to hire a graphics production person for a couple months now, and somehow their ad in the paper never made it to the classified ads on the website at the same time I was checking it out. So last week, I saw the ad for the first time, and went by on the same day that they had given up being able to hire anyone! The interview went great, they seemed excited about me, and everyone knows how desperate for a job I am, so I was radiating excitement, since this was basically my last shot at a computer-related job before I get a job as a Sandwich Artist.

Anyways, to make a long story short, they really dug me. At the beginning of the interview, the woman said she would call me by the end of the week. By the end of the interview, she said she would call me the next day. Sure enough, I got a call this morning asking me to start work tomorrow morning at 8:30! Whoo Hoo!

I'll post more details about the job when I have them. At the moment, I don't know anything except it's full-time with the possibility of benefits!
