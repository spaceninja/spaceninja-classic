Annie and I are about to jump in the car to go to Portland for the weekend for my cousin Jackie's wedding. Frankly, the thought of being without email, or worse, _World of Warcraft_ for the next few days is unappealing to say the least. Luckily, we're going to be pretty busy. We've got the wedding tonight, we're going to see _Team America_ at the Laurelhurst tomorrow afternoon, Jill is throwing a cocktail party tomorrow night, and we might even cram zoolights in there somewhere.

Also, I'm sure playing _Halo 2_ and _Katamari Damacy_ with Sean and Ryan will help take the edge off. WoW is definitely addicting. I'm fiending for it already.
