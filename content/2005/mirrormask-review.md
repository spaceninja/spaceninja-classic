I first heard that Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman were working on a movie a few years ago, and I tried not to get too excited, because who knew how it would turn out? But I was already thinking how cool it would be to get a good story with full-motion visuals by McKean. That movie is [Mirrormask](http://www.dreamline.nu/mirrormask/), it's out now, and it's excellent.

In [an interview](http://avclub.com/content/node/41034/2/1), Gaiman is quick to point out that this is McKean's movie. He helped write it, but the core concepts came from McKean, who [is also interviewed](http://avclub.com/content/node/41034/1/2), and paints a more collaborative picture of the writing process. It appears that McKean had the big ideas, and Gaiman helped flesh them out. In particular, Gaiman says that the existing ideas were a bit too straightforward, and he "roughed it up" and added some more complicated issues.

To brutally summarize, our heroine Helena performs in her parents' travelling circus. Her mother falls ill one night after a fight with Helena, who feels intense guilt for not apologizing. Her father tries to keep the circus afloat as Helena withdraws into a fantasy world of her illustrations, where she discovers the world divided into light and dark, with each side ruled over by a Queen. The light queen is asleep, and Helena embarks on a quest to find the charm that will wake her and restore balance and light to the world. In the course of the classic hero-circle storyarc, she befriends a local who guides her through various locations on the quest, including the Orbiting Giants shown in the photo.

While this is certainly not as deep as Gaiman's stories usually are, the classic fairy-tale structure is immediately recognizable, and McKean's touch is also evident, especially when paired with the incredible visuals.

Now, not to take away from the story, but the real reason to see this movie is the visuals. This movie looks exactly like the covers to the _Sandman_ comics, come to life and walking around. It was exactly what I was hoping for, and a lot is gained from the translation. Especially nice are the lingering rotating landscape shots that the movie delights in whenever we follow Helena into a new area.

In his interview, McKean points out that aside from the live actors and two sets that were built, the entire movie was built on the computer, and it's easy to believe when we see his trademark visual distortions and color blooms. Many things in the movie retain the collage look from the covers, as if they were built from clipped photos, but they take on a life of their own, and some familiar-looking characters like the sphinxes or the monkey birds are startling when they speak.

This project is the culmination of a 20-year professional relationship, and despite the difficulties they describe in their interviews, this movie clearly shows that they understand each other very well, and their efforts compliment one another. These two are at the peak of their talents, and this movie is an incredible animated visit into their imaginations.
