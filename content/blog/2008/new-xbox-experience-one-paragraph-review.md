The new dashboard is really slick. The entire thing has been overhauled, to the point where it feels like a brand new console, rather than just a software upgrade. At first, it's a little confusing if you're used to the "blades" interface, because everything has been moved around and reorganized, but I think the new system actually makes more sense, and certainly leaves more room to grow. The interface is dramatically improved from a design perspective, and while it no longer feels like I'm "at the helm of the future," the new design is certainly a better fit as part of a larger media center, which recognizes that games are just one part of what the xbox can do. The netflix integration works as expected, and there's a higher emphasis placed on streaming content from your PC to your xbox. The biggest change, though, is the avatar system. Much like the miis on the Wii, these are good for making a caricature of yourself, but it's hard to get something that looks just right. (In my case, I think it looks pretty good except for the skinny little cartoon neck, which makes it look too thin.) Of course, if you're not trying to make a photorealistic one, there is quite a bit more [potential](http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx?GamerTag=Gary+Dirin) for [insanity](http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx?GamerTag=MrJoshida). I haven't had a chance yet to try the feature I'm most excited about — ripping games to the hard drive to improve stability — because I fell asleep during the 20-minute copy process.
