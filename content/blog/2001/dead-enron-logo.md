Yesterday I submitted my entry to the [Viridian](http://www.viridiandesign.org/) "[Dead Enron Logo](http://www.bomoco.com/Viridian/Enron/Enron.htm)" contest. The basic idea was that Enron should have a new logo to reflect its new status as a dead company. I had seen on the news shots of people leaving the corporate headquarters, walking past a big metal version of their logo. I was imagining the building abandoned and decaying years later, with the metal logo all covered in rust. So a little photoshop time later, I produced my submission. You can look at it [locally](http://spaceninja.com/design/images/enron_spaceninja.jpg) or on my [DeviantArt](http://spaceninja.deviantart.com/) page.
