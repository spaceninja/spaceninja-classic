> A lady walks into a bar and sees a really cute guy sitting at the counter. She goes over and asks him what he is drinking.
> 
> "Magic Beer", he says
> 
> She thinks he's a little crazy, and says,"That isn't really Magic Beer, is it?"
> 
> "Yes, I'll show you." He takes a drink of the beer, jumps out the window, flies around the building three times, and comes back in.
> 
> The lady can't believe it: "I bet you can't do that again."
> 
> He takes another drink of beer, jumps out the window, flies around the building three times, and comes back in again.
> 
> She is so amazed that she says she wants a Magic Beer, so he says to the bartender, "Give her one of what I'm having."
> 
> She gets her drink, takes a gulp of the beer, jumps out the window, plummets 30 stories, breaks every bone in her body, and dies.
> 
> The bartender looks up at the guy and says, "You're a real asshole when you're drunk, Superman."
