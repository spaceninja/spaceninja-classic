I just finished importing a ton of old blog posts from various other sites, such as Peons, Eburg, KMorg, and of course, Hatelife. Plus, I manually imported the entries from my [original journal](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/blog/v1/), which kicks my "online since" tag back to [February 20, 1999](/1999/02/strange-day/), and brings my total time online up from 5 years to 6 years, 7 months. And according to my blog stats, there are currently 1,895 posts and 3,741 comments, contained within 24 categories.

Next task: setting up a better archives page, to allow me to more easily navigate the gigantic post list.
