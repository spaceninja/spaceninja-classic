In the last year, I tried to drive up my follower count on Twitter. I used a program that auto-followed people who mentioned keywords I was interested in. While this did dramatically increase my followers, the gains were misleading — the bulk of these accounts were unrelated or spam, and a large number immediately quit following me when I recently unfollowed them.

At this time last year, I had 265 followers on Twitter. I had been using it for about a year, and I carefully restricted the list of accounts I followed to around 100 — a mix of people I knew in real life and influential industry names, with a few funny accounts mixed in. I tweeted about stuff that I thought was funny, or commentary on web development. (Mostly complaining about Drupal and testing sites in IE.) I wasn't exactly burning up the charts, but I was happy with how I was using the site — communicating with a small audience that cared, and reading stuff that mattered to me.

I was about to speak at a conference about HTML5, and I let my boss convince me to alter my Twitter habits. He was helping me towards my career goal of becoming a recognized authority in the front-end industry, and he was convinced that increasing my follower count on Twitter was a strong metric to gauge my progress. He suggested that I make a search for anyone tweeting about the conference I was speaking at, and follow them — with the logic that they were likely my target audience. He suggested that I check back after a few weeks and unfollow any of them that hadn't followed me back. I did this, and easily gained around 100 followers. A modest gain, but still tripling my follower count. Encouraged by the easy win, I agreed to let my boss hook my account up to the auto-follow program he used.

I don't remember the name of the program, but the idea is that you feed it a set of keywords, and it will automatically follow anyone who mentions those terms. Then after two weeks, it automatically unfollows anyone who hasn't followed you back. Essentially automating the process I used for the conference.

We plugged my account into the program for the keywords “HTML5” and “CSS3,” and everything proceeded according to plan. My follower count climbed at a predictable rate of about 50 followers a week, peaking at around 1100 when I left the company (and the autofollow program) in April.

I mentioned earlier that I had to change my Twitter habits. Obviously, with this autofollow process, I couldn't keep my carefully curated group of accounts, so I did the next best thing. I created a Twitter list of the people I considered essential reading — my "real" follow list. I stopped viewing my primary Twitter stream at all, and only read this filtered list.

I had to do this because my primary Twitter stream was full of absolute garbage. Yes, in theory the autofollow program would find people who shared my interests — but it actually ended up following hundreds of spam accounts, real-estate people, coupon promoters, and robots. All of them had legitimately mentioned HTML5 or CSS3 at some point, but the overwhelming majority of tweets in the main stream were just noise.

Now, if we were sitting at a bar with my old boss and I was telling this story, he would put down his beer and explain that I was doing it wrong. He would argue that I should have manually unfollowed anyone who wasn't relevant to my interests, and perhaps tell you that I'm using Twitter wrong. "You're not meant to read every tweet. You should dip your toe into the stream and sample the collective groupthink of the moment," etc.

No doubt that method works for him, and some of you, and I wish you well, but it doesn't work for me. I follow people because I want to see what they have to say. I don't want to miss the tweet [@zeldman](http://twitter.com/zeldman/) posts about an awesome new CSS3 resource because it was drowned out in a rush of real estate, local coupon deals, and other garbage.

The final straw for me was a limitation from Twitter itself — Twitter lists don't show native retweets. Meaning if I follow someone, and put them on a list, and they use the built-in Twitter retweet function, those retweets won't show up on my list stream. I have no idea why this is, and frankly, it drives me crazy. Some of the big names I follow retweet the best industry news so that the original poster gets credit for it, and I was missing all of that.

Futhermore, when I looked around at the influential people I care about in the industry, they don't follow thousands of people. They have a carefully curated list of 100-200 people, even though they have tens or hundreds of thousands of followers.

So, about a month ago, I took a careful look at the way I was using Twitter, and decided to undo everything we had done. I bulk unfollowed everyone who wasn't on my filtered list, and sat down to watch the fireworks.

Observation one: Twitter was fun again. I was seeing retweets, and I didn't feel like I was avoiding my primary stream, or like I was somehow abusing the system. It was back to what I had originally fallen in love with — a tool for communicating with a small audience that cares, and reading stuff that matters to me.

Observation two: My follower count immediately started plummeting. Pretty much the day after I unfollowed nearly 900 people, my own follower count (which had been stable for months) immediately dropped by around 150. It has been steadily, albiet more slowly, dropping ever since, and I fully expect it to continue.

My conclusion: There's a strong contingent of people who treat Twitter as a straight-up SEO-style numbers racket. If you play the auto-follow game, you can absolutely inflate your follower count to an impressive number — but it doesn't _mean_ anything. Your reach hasn't actually increased because only a fraction of those people are actually reading anything you write.

Auto-follow is a false economy. It tricks you into believing that if you just click a few buttons, you can build an audience. While you can successfully drive up your numbers this way, the followers you gain are not the followers you want. As with anything else, the only way to gain an worthwhile audience is to [make something great, tell people about it and do it again](http://powazek.com/posts/2090).

If you enjoyed this, you can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/spaceninja/), but don't be offended if I don't follow you back. It's nothing personal.
