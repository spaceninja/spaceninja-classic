aww yeah.. my crazy intense up-at-the-crack-of-dawn in-the-office-for-uncountable-hours work week is over. started the new harry potter book. went out and fiddled on the streetcorner on my lunch break today. got a lesson tomorrow which promises to be good. everything's all right.  
  
  
now, can anyone point me in the direction of a nice classy wine rack? (first, let me find the swedish translation for "ikea is not an option"...)

picked up a nice wine rack and a bookshelf for my growing collections of wine and religion and philosophy books at fred meyer - if or when i no longer live near a fred meyer's, i'm really going to miss that place!
