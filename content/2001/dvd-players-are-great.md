Man, I have got to get me a DVD player. I just spent about four hours watching _Contact_ on Steve's DVD player. It's great to finish watching a movie, and then watch the behind-the-scenes stuff on how they did the special effects, and then switch the DVD in French dubbed mode and watch parts of the movie over again. If only it was also dubbed in Russian or German!

In case you don't know, I'm staying at Steve's apartment to watch his dog, Pi, for him. My plans for tomorrow:

- give Pi more of Steve's clothing, sheets and towels to tear up to keep her occupied.
- watch all his DVDs in frame-by-frame mode to check for hidden frames of pornography (sadly, none of the DVDs are from Disney, so I'm not expecting any results).
- finish eating all of Steve's food and drinking all his liquor.
- study up on ways to hack into a Windows 2000 box so I can format his hard drive and install Windows 3.1 before he gets home.

Yes, it's going to be a productive day!
