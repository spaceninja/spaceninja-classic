<P>7.12.99
<BR>On my way to work this morning, I was thinking, and I realized that Y2K is almost upon us... and no one seems to really care anymore. There was this huge media blitz around it, and then we were almost at war, and everyone forgot about it. Then once the "war" ended, people had forgotten about it. I think that's interesting. It's 5 months away, and you don't hear much about it anymore.

<P>I went to Lilith Fair over the weekend. It was cool. We spent entirely too much money going to see this concert at the Gorge and take the bus up there, but in the end I'd have to say it was worth it. This year is supposed to be the last Lilith Fair, and I'd never been to the Gorge before, so it was pretty cool. I got to see Luscious Jackson live, which I wanted to do, and then I got to see Sheryl Crow live. I'm not a huge fan of hers, but she really puts on a show. She came out, and people were instantly on their feet and clapping and everyone was into it... She's a good performer. Luscious Jackson wasn't as cool. They were kick-ass, and I love them, and they're totally non-pretentious, but they didn't put on nearly as good a show as Sheryl.

<P>Some highlights of the show: <UL>
<LI>Large lesbians wearing bras two sizes too small.
<LI>Dumb 14 year old girl yelling "That black guy on stage is my boyfriend!"
<LI>Other dumb 14 year old girls doing somersaults in skirts to impress guys.
<LI>Transexual person sitting to our right, eating flowers.
<LI>Everyone wearing bikinis, including many people who shouldn't have.
<LI>Our personal fantasy that Jill (lead singer of Luscious Jackson) was going to beat up Liz Phair for her dress.
<LI>Annie hearing the "real" lyrics to songs... ("You fuck like a volcano..." from Liz Phair and "We found Marylin's dildo..." from Sheryl Crow...)
<LI>20-30 people is a SHORT line for the restroom.
<LI>Girl in transparent tube top making our sandwiches.
<LI>An hour to get out of the parking lot.
<LI>rub-on tattoos.</UL>

<P>In other news, on the fourth of July, KT, Erica, Jester, Annie and myself headed to the waterfront to watch fireworks. There were lots of people there, and we finally just found a place to sit and watch. Jester had difficulty finding a good compliment for brown eyes (your eyes... as brown as fine leather... your eyes, as brown as the Willamette River... your eyes, as blue as something that is not blue). KT repeatedly invited Jester to come home with her, and even spelled it out for him at one point (T-H-I-S I-S Y-O-U-R B-I-G C-H-A-N-C-E), but he didn't seem to catch on. And KT even put clean sheets on the bed.

<P>If you don't know KT, just trust me that this was all very humerous.

<P>I came up with a new phone message today. I was rather pleased. I take pride in coming up with clever phone messages, and the one I just had was pretty painful. The new one says: "Hi, you've reached the voice mail for a cybernautic spider monkey. I'm not able to get to the phone right now, but if you want to leave a message for my keepers, Annie Stockman and Scott Vandehey, you can do so after the tone. Thanks."
