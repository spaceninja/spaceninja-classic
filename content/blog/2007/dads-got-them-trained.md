Those of you who serve as tech support for your families will appreciate this. Every now and then someone in the extended family will send an email to everyone with the latest urgent virus warning. Since these are almost always total bunk, my Dad (Ted) has gotten in the habit of replying with a polite email explaining that it's a hoax trying to trick you into spamming everyone you know. He usually backs this up by linking to the relevant page on [snopes.com](http://www.snopes.com/).

This morning, I received the following email from a family member (formatting left intact):

**THIS JUST CAME IN AND SINCE NORM CHECKED IT WITH SNOPES IT MUST BE AUTHENTIC. FOR ONCE I AM SENDING IT ON AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD, TOO. IF OUR RESIDENT GURU,TED, DISAGREES LET HIM SPEAK NOW**

Unfortunately, the email was referring to the out-of-date "[Osama Virus](http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/osama.asp)" from a few years back, so Dad still had to step in and explain why this wasn't the ticking time bomb the email made it out to be - but it cracked me up that Dad's got the family trained to check with Snopes before forwarding any dire warnings.
