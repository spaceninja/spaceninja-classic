I had to go to three different churches today ranging from cool to tolerable, to un-fucking-believable. (no offense to anyone who happens to belong to a born-again christian cowboy church..)

See, I'm taking Sociology of Religion, and part of our grade is to go to four different churches, preferably some that make us uncomfortable, and write a paper on what we observe. In a class like this, you have to respect everyone's religion and try not to offend the southern baptist in the back row. So I'm used to discussing religion from a sociological point of view right?

It's such an experience for someone like me who never belonged to a church to have to go to church (when I'm usually sleeping mind you) and participate in rituals and prayers that one, I'm not familiar with, and two, don't agree with. It's such a trip to sit there and listen with respect to someone who is talking about "wacko eastern religions" and "Satan is talking to people who ignore the true word that we're sharing with them."

He was totally disrespectful to other Christians even! amazing. this has been an incredible learning experience for me...

Question: I've come to terms with the fact that people assume that I'm some sort of christian even though I'm not... but Scott also assumed I was baptized even though he knows my family never belonged to a church. Do most denominations baptize people?
