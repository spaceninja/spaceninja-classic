Hello!

<p>regarding pet of the future and the track "colossus"....

<p>I was randomly -- and I mean *randomly* -- doing some web searching related
to my band when I stumbled upon, no kidding, one of my songs, on one of
*your* compilatons. You can imagine my surprise. Did you email me, at any
point, regarding this? Perhaps you did; for awhile there, much of my email
on this account was lost. All the same, I'm curious...what the hell is your
project? How did you happen upon "colossus" ? What did you *do* to it? =)

<p>I'm not upset, just curious. It's interesting to see Pet of the Future stuff
popping up places I could never have imagined. Guess it's easy to forget how
crazily the internet works; outside of <a href="http://www.mp3.com/">mp3.com</a>, the cd that "colossus" is on
was basically never, at any point, publicized. At all. Anyhow, check out
<a href="http://www.petofthefuture.com/">petofthefuture.com</a> if you're interested in more recent developments, and
please drop me a note regarding your site. Is that CD for real? It almost
looks like your site is just a big gag, but these days, who can tell for
sure?

regards,
-Michael Holloway, Pet of the Future.

<p>Yellow Number Five is a completely fictional band. My name is Scott
Vandehey, and I'm not sure if you remember me, but we actually met at
Portland State University (which is how I've heard of Pet)!

<p>When I was updating the Y5 page, I decided they needed a new "release"
so I compiled a track listing of some of the songs I was listening to at
the time, which included your track Colossus.

<p>Just to reassure you, once again, Yellow Number Five is completely
fictional, and this compilation album was never even created, let alone
produced, or sold for money. It sounds like you're not worried, but I
have a lot of respect for musicians, and I wouldn't actually do
something like that without at least getting permission. ;)
