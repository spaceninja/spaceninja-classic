In the mid-90s, Kevin Smith was approached to write a script for a new Superman movie, which would later be rumored to be directed by Tim Burton with Nicholas Cage playing Superman. We're lucky it didn't get made because Burton and Cage aren't exactly the pair I imagine doing Superman the right way, but it turns out there's a worse enemy for Superman out there - the _producer_. Go watch this [video of Kevin Smith telling the funniest Superman story you've ever heard](http://www.youtube.com/w/Superman-Lives?v=gUU_Vs1BL0E&eurl).
