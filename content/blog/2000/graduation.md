[![Scott's Graduation](/images/219248341_23ae203be3.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/219248341/)

It's an interesting (frustrating) feeling to go through your college graduation ceremony, knowing full well that a week later, you'll be going back to school to complete your last class.

The ceremony was kinda cool. We had to sit by major, but I got to sit by two of my friends. The mayor of Portland got up and started a speech by saying that she didn't remember her college commencement address, and wanted to avoid being boring. Then she proceeded to give a long political speech that I already can't remember. Last year's class got President Clinton, This year, we get Vera Katz. Oh well. At least I can say I'm class of 2000.
