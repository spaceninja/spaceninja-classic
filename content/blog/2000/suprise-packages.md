Okay... Annie went out to get the mail today, and came back with two packages, instead of the bills we were expecting! One of the packages was from my Uncle Bruce and Aunt Michelle in Alaska, who sent us a post for no particular reason. Cool. The other package was from Jay and Silent Bob. It turned out to be statuette of Buddy Christ from the movie Dogma, which we loved! But who was it from? We had no idea. Turns out to be Pat. Thanks, Pat! It's sitting on top of Annie's monitor now, and as soon as we get a webcam, people will be seeing a lot of it. My favorite part of the packaging is where it says "Our Father, Who Art In This Box."
