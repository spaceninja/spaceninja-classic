<br>WATCH OUT! SON OF GUN! SUPER-HERO-NUMBER-ONE!!
<br>~kmfdm <i>son of a gun</i>

<P>I'm excited. It's really really cool when someone that you've admired for awhile suddenly writes you an email saying great stuff. About a year ago, Steve showed me a link to this guy's website. It's the "<a href="http://www.xmission.com/~maddox/">best damn web page in the universe</a>." It's just a big page of rants by the guy, and I love it. I check it out every few weeks to see if he's added a new one and it just cracks me up. So I added a <A HREF="http://www.spaceninja.com/home/links.html">link</a> on my website to his page.

<P>Today, at work, bored, I visited his site to see if he updated, and he'd done some large overhauls. Among the many changes, he had added me to his page of links. I was amazed. I've never spoken to the guy before, just viewed his website and linked to it, and now he was linking to me! "Great design, cool overall." I showed Miles, and we concluded that he must have found my site through watching his access logs and seeing the link on my page.

<P>So I decided to drop him and email and thank him for linking to me. I also told him that Steve named his server after one of the rants on his site! (Fojar comes from the article called "<a href="http://www.xmission.com/~maddox/moon.html">Let's blow up the moon!</a>") Within a half hour, I had an email back from him. I'm just going to post it here:

<P>Hey Scott, I'm glad to finally be in touch with you guys.  A long time ago
I noticed some links in my access log from people coming to my site with
http://www.spaceninja.com/home/links.html.  It's ironic that you like my
site, as I often find myself going to <a href="http://www.spaceninja.com/">spaceninja.com</a> for web design ideas
and to show my friends examples of how web pages should look.

<P>I'm thrilled that your server is named <a href="http://www.fojar.com/">fojar</a>.  My friend and I were just
talking about the word "fojar" the other night, and I couldn't remember
where I had used that word before (we have code words for everything)!  I
checked out fojar.com, and the art/style is awesome.  Unfortunately, I
don't have a Mac and wasn't able to check out Mutton Kombat.  What's it
written in?  By the way, is all the art on fojar done by you?  That
"MUTTON KOMBAT" gif on the <a href="http://play.fojar.com/">play.fojar.com</a> page
(http://play.fojar.com/mk.gif) reminds me of the style on Batman the
animated series.  Very cool.  Anyway, that link I have to spaceninja
doesn't do you guys justice, I'll have to update my links when I get a
chance.  Talk to you later,
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>I'm stunned. Here I am, admiring this guy, and he's writing me an email saying that he likes the stuff I do! Miles saw me getting excited and said to Mark that he didn't think I would be any more excited if I got a letter from Milla Jovovich herself! (we just watched <i>fifth element</i> last night).

<P>If I babble about this any more, I'm just going to sound like a moron, so I'm going to shut up and just say that I'm excited.

<P><I>In case you're curious, yes, I did all the art on fojar, and the mutton kombat image is kmfdm album-cover style.</I>
