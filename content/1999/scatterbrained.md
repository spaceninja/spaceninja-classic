Too scatterbrained to write much right now, so I'm going to update you by category.

Girlfriend/Home: In case you didn't hear, these two have merged. Annie and I live together now in a lovely place called Goose Hollow. We got a one-bedroom apartment with orange counter-tops, and got all moved in over three days. Things are going well, on the whole, though we are discovering a few areas of conflict, as expected. It's all small stuff though, nothing to threaten the relationship. I really love her, and things are going well.

Work: Lots of stuff going on here. I'm working on three jobs right now. One is the same old job as a lab attendant in Shattuck. That's going great, Mark gave me 37 hours/week, so I should be raking in the cash this summer. The second is that I applied for a position on the Tek team, which looks very promising. It's probably less pay, and definitely less hours, but Mark would let me keep this job (at less hours) and still work there, so I should be pulling in a similar amount of hours, and the pay would be close. But the opportunity is great. Network experience for my resume, more experience with other operating systems, and of course, I'd be working with Steve and Miles, which would be a blast. Should be pretty cool! The third is the team I've joined. Miles, Steve and myself have hooked up with Dennis and his girlfriend to create a team called PDXmart. It's an online mall project which is pretty exciting. Miles and Steve are the programmers, I'm the head designer/HTML guy, and Dennis and his girlfriend are the brains of the outfit. Dennis drives us pretty hard, but I have to admit that in less than three weeks we've already gotten a great looking site up at [www.pdxhookup.com](http://www.pdxhookup.com/). It's the first "store" in the mall, though an online classifieds site doesn't really count as a store. It looks great, and we're all proud of how well it's performing. It's kinda frustrating not having as much free time as I thought I would over the summer, but it's really good experience, and it loads up my resume quickly!

Internet: Steve's server is performing well, and [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.local/) is alive and kicking. My personal site looks great, my new email address works great, and I'm proud of the whole thing. I do still owe money on the name, but I'll get that paid soon enough.

I'll write more when I'm feeling less scatter-brained.

Oops! Almost forgot... Money's not as bad as last time I wrote, because Annie got a job at a used-clothing store, which will cover us until she starts Americorps.
