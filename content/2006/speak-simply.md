> Speak simply? Got it. "So we drive around in these wheeled car things that have armor on them, and we occasionally meet people who don't like us. Sometimes we have to run them over, or perhaps make holes in them using our boom sticks." \-- Sig commenting on [military guidelines for speaking to the press](http://www.sigspace.net/node/291)
