We're going to get a DSL connection here at my parent's house. This will enable me to do work for my new job (did I mention that it's a telecommuting position?) without having to put up with the 30-second lag time that I sometimes get when working in a telnet window. Hopefully, it will be in within a couple weeks and I can stop surreptitiously working from the tek room. That's my news. Now on to the rest of my family:

Annie sprained her ankle at work. It was bad enough that yesterday she went to the doctor, who gave her codeine, a brace, and orders to stay off her feet for a few days. She's currently doped up and sitting in my Dad's armchair, watching comedy central. But she does seem to be doing well, and the doctor thinks she'll be doing alright in a matter of weeks.

Ryan gave us a call a few nights ago, letting us know that one of his so-called friends had punched him in the face to convince him not to get married. Apparently, he has a small group of these friends who are convinced that getting married to Molli is the worst possible thing he could do, and when trying to talk him out of it failed, they threatened violence. One of these friends came to visit, and after letting Ryan buy him a drink, walked outside with him and punched him in the face. Then he ran away, shouting profanities behind him. It's a big mess, and basically we're all just confused about what's going on. I'm sure ryan will post the details to his journal at some point, so I'll let him tell the story on his own.

Plus, Steve's been sick all week, Miles is on the verge of being deported, and my Mom's having troubles with her boss. HAPPY OCTOBER, EVERYONE! Things can only get better from here!
