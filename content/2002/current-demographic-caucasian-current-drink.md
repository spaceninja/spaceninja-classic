Preparations are underway for Secret Project Saturday Thanksgiving. We're having over the usual Saturday night crew (minus Steve and Daniel who had "better" things to do), and making up some kind of festive meal. I think the menu as it stands right now is:

- 1 Tofurkey (provided by Zima, for her and Annie's enjoyment)
- 1 bucket KFC Chicken (for the rest of us lazy slobs who can't cook a turkey, but don't want tofu)
- mashed potatoes (provided by miles, mashed by zima, who has some aggression to let out)
- stuffing (from KT)
- 2 Safeway brand pumpkin pies with Safeway brand non-dairy whipped topping
- Some sort of real fruit pie from Zach to counter-balance the Safeway pies
- Apple Cider (both hot and cold)
- probably other sundries like salad (in a bag) and rolls (from Safeway)

Yeah, we're all about the gourmet food here!  
  
And in movie news, Annie and I went and saw the new James Bond movie, which was sweet. Since it's the 20th movie, they made lots of references to all the old movies. It's great!
