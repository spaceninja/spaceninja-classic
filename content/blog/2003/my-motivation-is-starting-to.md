My motivation is starting to come back. Over the weekend, I was thinking about my goals in life, and trying to find a way to deal with the sort of listlessness I've been dealing with since graduation. It was easier to ignore in Ellensburg, because my goal was to get out of Ellensburg, and I had the radio station to distract me. But lately, it's been hitting me full force that while my job has considerable advantages, it's not exactly fufulling, and I don't want to do it forever. That, coupled with the realization that nothing in my life will change unless I make the changes myself, has resulted in a momentary burst of goal setting and motivation.

First of all, I've been basically crippling my ability to enjoy any side projects I start because I have the crunchpod designs sitting on my back, waiting for me to finish them. My number one priority is to finish these designs, as quickly as possible, so that I can quit feeling guilty about delaying Ben's release dates, and so I have some new material for my portfolio.

Secondly, I've decided to start taking fojar-related projects more seriously. The only thing that I can really see myself enjoying for a living is working in web development projects with Steve and Miles. I spend all my free time working on these "side projects" and when I research new web techniques, I'm usually thinking of a way to apply them to one of our sites. So Steve and I have agreed to put aside 3-4 hours once a week to get together and work exclusively on fojar-related projects, like finishing Forum 5000 and Cookie! and improving our existing sites to attract more paying customers.

There are some other, smaller goals, that I won't get into here, but the point is that I'm finally feeling like I can do something to improve my station in life and get more satisfaction from what I do for a living.
