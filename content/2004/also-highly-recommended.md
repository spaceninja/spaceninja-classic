Add to the previous [highly recommended list](/2004/09/highly-recommended/): _Sky Captain._ We went to see it the other night, and it's excellent. They absolutely nailed the feel of the old Superman cartoons and other older-style superhero stories like Flash Gordon. The main characters never miss a beat, never seem concerned about the fact that mad scientists are attacking New York with giant robots. The star of the show is obviously the visuals. The look of the film is incredible, and all the industrial design is amazing. But the story is strong enough to stand on its own, and the characters are definitely interesting. I would go see a sequel in a heartbeat.
