You know it seems odd to say that now, but I remember when I was younger it was common practice for me to just call Ryan and Sean "Brothers" as if it was one collective name they shared. "Brothers, wanna go outside?" "Please don't cry, brothers!" "Dad, brothers did it!"

I just wanted to wish you guys a happy birthday here since I know you both read this site, and since there are no good e-card sites anywhere and I'm too poor to buy either of you a real card (or gift).

So Happy Twenty... (um, let's see, they're three years younger than me, and I'm 22, so they're 19 now... so yeah...) _Happy Twentieth Birthday, Ryan and Sean!_
