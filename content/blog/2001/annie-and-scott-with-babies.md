Yesterday, some of Annie's friends came to town to visit, and they brought along a newborn baby with them. Reanne's 1.5 month-old baby was a little fussy, what with all the traveling and strange people, but Annie was still shocked when he started screaming every time she picked him up. The other three babies she's been around have been really good-natured and friendly babies, so it kind of took her by surprise that a baby might not like her. And just to add insult to injury, my mom asked to hold the baby after Annie, and the instant she picked him up, he stopped screaming. At which point we all started laughing at Annie.

My parents have a digital camera, which they immediately whipped out, and before the night was over, they had emailed [this photo](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2926460668/) off to everyone in my family, as well as Annie's parents. Pretty quickly, we got this reply from Annie's dad:

> Very nice y'all - don't be a-goin' getting big ideas now - I'll come down there and bring said future mother of Vandehey heir home with me - I know y'all don't want to force me to such drastic measures - don't make me get itchy-accelerator-foot now - settle down - breathe, etc. Be reasonable, now. These things must be done delicately, etc. You hear me, Daughter? Don't let them grandchild-greedy Vandeheys talk you into anything, now. And Mr. Scott - don't make me come down there. We don't want a scene, now. Nice and easy does it.

After we all finished laughing, I decided I should get off my butt and post these photos I've been meaning to show of us with various babies.

- [This](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2926460596/) is me with Gavin, our friend's baby from Ellensburg.
- [This](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2926460716/) is Annie and I with the twins Annie was baby-sitting in Tacoma this summer. Annie's got Luke (with his sad little cast on his leg), I've got Zack, and their big sister is standing between us.
- [This](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2926460686/) is me and the boys, catching a nap together. Zack fell asleep on me, and Luke's sleeping in the baby chair.
- [This](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2926460668/) is the photo of Annie and I with Jordan.

**Edit 1/11/2008:** Funny to read this post now, and think that there was a time when photos of Annie and I with babies was unusual, rather than the norm!
