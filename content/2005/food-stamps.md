We applied for food stamps last week. The online application took four hours to complete. It was about 50 pages of questions covering everything from medical history to work and financial situations. Each page took about a minute to submit and load the next page for some reason (is their server really that taxed, or do they have it on a bank of modems?).

Over the weekend, we got a letter from DSHS telling us that we needed to come in for an interview. They had scheduled us an apointment for February 9th at 3pm. Unfortunately, Annie's working at that time, and I don't have a way to get there on my own.

So I called to reschedule. After taking my information the woman on the phone says "Okay, we're sending you a new letter."

What?

After going back and forth with this woman a few times, I learn that they DON'T HAVE any way to schedule an appointment. They can only send letters with a random appointment time on them, and if that one doesn't work either, you have to call to reschedule again. Plus, if you don't get your interview within 30 days of submitting your application, you have to start over and re-apply.

I explain to this woman why we can't make the first appointment and she grudgingly concedes that she will try to get us an appointment sometime before noon on a weekday, but that she can't promise anything.

This is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. Even Qwest didn't have anything this dumb. So we're waiting for the next letter with our next random appointment time to see if we can make it.

If Annie had a normal job, we could just ask for a day off, but Nanny jobs don't really work that way.
