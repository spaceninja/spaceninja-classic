[This post](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/04/27/battlestar-caprica/) over on Binary Bonsai tipped me off to a couple of news stories from the SciFi channel.

Firstly, there's going to be [_Caprica_](http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=35773), A _Battlestar Galactica_ spin-off, set 50 years before the return of the Cylons. It will follow two families, including the Adamas, and it will explore "corporate intrigue, techno-action and sexual politics." It's still got Ron Moore as executive producer, and Remi Aubuchon, who writes for _24_, so it could be pretty good.

Secondly, they're bringing back [Jack on Stargate](http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=2&id=35782&type=0)! He'll be guest-starring in two _SG-1_ episodes, and three _Atlantis_ episodes. More importantly, however, the 200th episode of _SG-1_ will revisit the _Wormhole Extreme!_ storyline for the _W:E_ movie! I'm stoked!
