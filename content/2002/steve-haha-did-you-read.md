**Scott:** no! haha where's the story?  
**Steve:** it's on slashdot.. let me find the original  
**Steve:** \[http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/10/15/0044255&tid=109\] there, there's a bunch of links off that one  
**Scott:** hahaha the stock photo was of the person? So they're not using the real people in the ads? hahahahaha  
**Scott:** Headline: _Microsoft deems general populace "too ugly" for ad campaign._
