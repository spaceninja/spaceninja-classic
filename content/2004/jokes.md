I have been cracking up all morning reading the jokes from [this site](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/06/18/favorite-jokes) - there are some really good ones in there... I might even post a couple that Daniel told me. Here's my favorite one, though:

> A traffic cop pulls over Werner Heisenberg. He walks up to Heisenberg and asks, “Do you know how fast you were going?”
>
> “No, but I can tell you exactly where I am.”
>
> [(Don't get it?)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)
