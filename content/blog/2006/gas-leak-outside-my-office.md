We just came back from lunch, and there are like 8 trucks and vans from the gas company clustered around a manhole cover (or something) and about four fire trucks parked nearby. This is less than a block from the front door of my building. They're stringing up caution tape everywhere, and the fire department actually has Broadway blocked off. I work right next to the train station, so this is pretty much the first block right after you come off the bridge - I don't think I've ever seen Broadway blocked off before. Obviously, there's some sort of gas leak, but this is kind of creepy.

**Update @ 1:50** One of my coworkers found a link to a [news story on KGW](http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_071106_news_gas_leak_.1eb62c4.html) about the gas leak. All the fire trucks have moved away from the corner where they were congregated before, and are now all parked directly outside our building. There's a full block or two roped off, and I heard several people (including my boss) mentioning that they couldn't get to their cars in the lot across from us. The bus station has been evacuated, but I guess not the train station.

There's also a strong hissing or whining sound outside. I guess the news report says the gas leak is audible, but it seems more likely that we're hearing some sort of machinery, like a drill or one of those sidewalk cutting saws.

I took some photos, but since all that's visible from where we are is a lot of parked vehicles, fire-fighters, and gas company employees, they're nothing dramatic.
