I just realized that I never posted any New Year's resolutions this year. That's probably because I never chose any - which is probably because I've done such a lousy job of keeping them up in the past. In 2004, I achieved [2 out of 5](/new-years-resolutions/) resolutions (eat breakfast every day, and do more design). In 2005, I accomplished [3 out of 5](/new-years/) resolutions (get up at a regular time every day, do more web design, and post more frequently, with more images). And finally, in 2006, I dropped down to [1 out of 4](/new-years-resolutions-2/) (attend more web conferences), which is particularly humiliating, since I went out of my way to choose goals that I would be more motivated to accomplish.

The getting up at a regular time and eating breakfast every day probably sound pathetic, but remember that when I wrote those goals, I was working from home or unemployed, and it was actually becoming a problem. I managed to achieve them, though, which I still feel proud of myself for, though now that I have a regular job, it's less of an accomplishment.

As for this year, it's already July, so it's too late for New Year's resolutions, but I do still have some goals. I want to finish posting my photo archives on flickr, I want to keep posting a newsletter about Zoe every month. Not exactly earth-shattering, I know, but hopefully more realistic than the last few years.
