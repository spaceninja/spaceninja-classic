I'm sure you all have heard my [rants about Qwest](/2001/11/screw-qwest-and-the-horse-they-rode-in-on/) before, so I won't [repeat them](/2001/12/well-tonight-is-the-night/). Suffice to say that since I'm moving, and I need my DSL up and running ASAP, I started to get the ball rolling three weeks early.

Long story short, it turns out that the problem this time isn't with Qwest. They are offering very fast and reasonable service to move my existing phone service to our new apartment. The problem is that the apartment they gave us is the one their manager used to live in, and whatever phone company she had hasn't turned off phone service in the apartment yet, even though she moved out on the first of the month. When told that they needed to turn off service ASAP because another tenant was moving in, they suggested that the new tenant just use the existing phone service for awhile. So the apartment is currently battling with them and calling every day. Currently, service is supposed to be off by Friday. If it's not off by Tuesday, the apartment manager assured me that they would just give me another unit instead, so that I can get my DSL turned on in time.

So that's a little frustrating, but at least the people I'm dealing with (Qwest and the apartment managers) are being good about it, it's this mysterious other phone company that's causing problems. Of course, I'm not going to start singing Qwest's praises just yet. All I have so far are promises, which sound good, but this wouldn't be the first time they've lied to me.

So what's the good news? Turns out we paid Last Month's Rent when we moved in, so our landlord returned our final rent check and was really nice about it, rather than being a jerk and just cashing it, since we obviously forgot. So we have $750 more than we thought, which will come in handy when my employment runs out.

Oh also, I went to see _Resident Evil 2_ last night with Eric and Jeff, and it was excellently bad. Loved it. Rocket Launcher Zombies = good.
