I've had a few inquiries about whether [Dojo](http://spaceninja.local/dojo/) works under Wordpress 2.7, and the answer is yes! You can drop it in, and it'll work just fine. However, there are some new features to allow comment threading and paging which don't work yet. It's not broken, it just uses the old non-threaded, non-paged comment style. I'm in the process of adding these and a few other new features, and I should have a new version of Dojo ready to download within a week. Thanks for your interest, and check back soon!

**Update:** And, it's done! [Dojo 5.1.2](http://spaceninja.local/dojo/) is released with full Wordpress 2.7 support.
