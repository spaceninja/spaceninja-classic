I've been working on job stuff and KillingMachines all day, Annie and I just got back from buying groceries ($160! Yikes!), and I'm about to go watch _Joe Millionaire_ with KT, so no time for any "real" thoughts, but here's some funny unter-net stuff that will help tide you over...

- [Icon Wars](http://www.divstivs.plus.com/iconwar/) - my dad sent me this one. Pretty funny flash animation.
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy Text Adventure Game](http://www.douglasadams.com/creations/infocomjava.html) - the 80s InfoCom game redone to run in your browser through a java app... Anyone besides Miles remember how to beat the Babelfish puzzle?
- [Happy Tree Friends](http://www.happytreefriends.com/) - I have no words to accurately describe this flash animation site Daniel showed us over the weekend. You'll just have to watch it. Not for the weak of heart.
- [Darn Good Solutions](http://darngoodsolutions.com/) - Steve showed me this amazing site, where they offer to produce your site for $300... or let you build it yourself for $15.
- [Clip from _Final Flight of the Osiris_](http://mediaviewer.ign.com/ignMediaPage.jsp?channel_id=157&article_id=385121&adtag=network%3Dign%26site%3Dfilmforceviewer%26pagetype%3Darticle&page_title=The+Final+Flight+of+the+Osiris) - A clip from one of the forthcoming [AniMatrix](http://www.theanimatrix.com/) shorts. This is the one by the guys that did the Final Fantasy movie. Jaw-Droppingly Beautiful.
- [Random Bond Movie Title Generator](http://isometric.sixsided.org/cgi-bin/randombond.pl) - Okay, it's not quite ready for prime-time yet, but Miles adapted his [Random Hero Name Generator](http://isometric.sixsided.org/cgi-bin/randomhero.pl) to create James Bond movie titles... Suprisingly accurate!
