I just remembered a crazy dream I had last night. My brother Sean and I had found a submarine. Not one of the huge nuclear powered ones, but one of the smaller two-person subs, like you see in the movie _the Abyss_. I was back in NE Portland, and the streets had flooded to about 10 feet deep, which didn't bother us at all, because we were tooling around in our submarine. It was awesome. I remember later in the dream walking around (apparently the flood had receded?) with an old high school friend and bragging about my submarine.
