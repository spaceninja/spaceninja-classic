I just took a survey, and one of the questions it asked was: "In an average month, how many times do you access the Internet or online services? (Please write in your best estimate)."

I don't even know how to begin to estimate this. Do I assume 10 times a day? 100? If I'm pretty much constantly online, does it just count as a single access? My answer could be anywhere from 1 to 3000.

I ended up putting 3000 just because it quickly gives the idea that I'm online all the time, but what a rediculous question.
