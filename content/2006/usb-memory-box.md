The [USB Memory Box](http://www.dialog05.com/objects/07.html) is part of a larger project called [Universal Connections by Dialog05](http://www.dialog05.com/). It takes computer plugs like USB and Firewire cables, and works them into everyday items like trash cans and telephone handsets. Most of the items either play on words and concepts (like a USB crowbar for digital breaking and entering, or a USB syringe for computer viruses), but the memory box in particular hit me as a clever concept, and somewhat practical. While I prefer to keep all my photos in my gallery program, the day is quickly coming when I simply won't be able to do that, due to the sheer volume of the photos involved. I could easily see something like this, combined with an easy-to-use means to display the photos being very popular. \-- via [Infosthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2006/03/universal_connections_phyical_icons_dialog05.html)
