> "If high school is supposed to be the best time of our whole life, then I'm in a lot of trouble." \-- Laura

I don't miss high school one bit. I don't think I really realized how much I hated it until it was over. My friends at the time were really fake people. I think that's why I'm so picky now about who I'm close with. My friends are all very real people.

When I graduated, I remember that for the most part, I just felt relief. Now I could leave that section of my life behind me. Never again would I be forced to spend time with those people. And in the intervening four years, I have avoided all of my old high school friends with maybe four exceptions who I'm still friends with. I went to a school with 1500 students, and out of them all, there were FOUR people who I still consider worth knowing?? What does this say about the kind of people I knew in high school?

Steve is one of the people that I'm still friends with from high school. We skipped prom together. I don't know how it went at your high school, but at our high school, prom was a huge, over-blown event. We didn't particularly want to go. It was just overhyped. It had become almost a political thing, a contest for the popular people to play in. We wanted no part of it. I think the day we finally said "screw it, we're boycotting the prom," was the day that we mentioned that we might not go to a teacher, and she told us that we had to. Excuse me? We HAVE to? Forget that.

After that, we decided not only not to go, but to hold an ANTI-PROM. We made plans with a few other friends of ours who weren't going (I don't remember if they weren't going for the same political reasons we weren't). The night of prom, Steve and I wandered over to this guy's house, and we four watched bad movies and ate chocolate bars. We watched "Knight Rider 2000." It was horrible. There was some special ability that the car had that we all got a kick out of, but I don't remember what.

As the date of the anti-prom approached, Steve and I took pleasure in announcing our plans to anyone who stood around long enough to ask. Most people would ask who we were going to prom with (note the unspoken assumption that EVERYONE is going to prom), and we would proudly answer that we were not going to prom, and were going to hold an anti-prom instead. At this point most people would look at us like we had spit on their shoes. No one really understood that it was a political reaction against the institution that prom had become. I can't count the number of times that people told us we would someday regret that we didn't go.

Well you know what? It's been four years and I STILL don't regret it. Y'all can suck it.

Prom was kind of the focal point of how much high school sucked. The way everyone got into and took part in their horrid little popular political plays.

AARGH...

I hate high school so much that I can't even write about it coherently. I intended a well-thought out entry about why I hated high school and why I am glad it's behind me. I am filled with disgust and contempt for everything high-school related. I think I'll just let my buddy max sum it up for me:

"high school is kinda pukey."
