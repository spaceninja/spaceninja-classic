I was just working on my home page a little, and was updating my Ideal Jeopardy categories, and here's what I came up with:

- Web design
- Bad movies
- Downtempo techno music
- Preparing canned and boxed foods
- Comic books
- Science fiction
- Effective communication

Annie was helping me, so of course we did hers, too.

- Babies
- Strawberries
- Ensembles
- Spell checking
- Shiny objects
- Feminist literature
- Social theory
