Well, **someone** has to make the first post after the naked girl, even though no one will read it... so it might as well be me updating you all on the fascinating happenings of my life.  
  
Annie's brother Dave (I guess I should get used to saying "my brother-in-law Dave") was here for a couple days. He was only going to stay overnight on Tuesday so he could go to a job interview in Vancouver on Wednesday morning, but they rescheduled his interview after he had already started driving down, so he just stayed for another night. Which was great, because we got to go out to Gustav's with him, and he got to stay for Miyazaki night, which was fun (though the movie wasn't the best).  
  
He brought down my copy of [Age of Mythology](http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/) down with him, so now he and I can play against each other online, since we both have broadband now. It's the first time I've really been into the concept of online gaming much, and I'm pretty excited!  
  
Oh, and some of you might be interested to know that [Worms 3](http://www.worms3.com/) is going to be released sometime this year, for all three consoles (and PC, of course)... which means we'll be able to play worms on the xbox! w00t!
