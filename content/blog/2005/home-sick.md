Stayed home sick today. Went to bed early and got 12+ hours of sleep, but still feel like shit. Probably because of waking up every couple of hours. The only good news is my nose isn't runny any more, it's just clogged, so maybe this will be one of those fast colds and I'll be able to go to work tomorrow.

I feel like a tool, because I gave my notice that I was quitting my job and then immediately took a sick day. Oh well.

Oh, if you hadn't heard I was quitting my job, stay tuned. I'll write about it once I feel up to sitting at the computer for more than about 10 minutes.
