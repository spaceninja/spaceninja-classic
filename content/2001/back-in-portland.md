Ah, it's good to be back in Portland. It'll be better once I have a job and an apartment, but it's still good right now. Things with living at home again are going smoother than I expected. Both my parents and I are falling over each other trying not to step on each other's toes. Considering that I was expecting it to be kinda tense at home, that's very good.

I talked to Annie last night, and her surgery went fine. She's sleeping a lot right now, which is what she always does when she's doped up on pain killers.

I possibly got a web design job! This guy found me on [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.local/) and emailed me to ask for a quote. Apparently I gave him the best deal, because he said he wants me to do it! As soon as he gets the money together, he's going to have me produce a site for him.

Oh, and still no word from those jerks over at Network Solutions. For those of you who don't know, spaceninja's up for renewal, and I tried to switch registrars to [joker.com](http://www.joker.com/) which has better prices, and they told me that the transfer was denied by Network Solutions, the current registrar! I'm not entirely surprised, since tales about NS's fishy behavior abound, but I am angry. So far they haven't answered my inquiries about why they denied the transfer, so I'm going to send them a few more emails. Grrr.
