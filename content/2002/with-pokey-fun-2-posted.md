With [POKEY FUN 2](http://www.yellow5.com/pokey/hooray/WONDERFULpokey.html) posted, now seems like a good time to start:  
  
BE NICE TO CARTOONISTS WEEK  
  
As a person who makes a web comic, I notice that the mail I get about the comic tends to be divided about 10 to 1. That is, one nice fan mail for every 10 complaints about not updating frequently enough, or some strip that someone didn't like, or why I haven't linked to someone's website.  
  
I don't believe people mean to send nothing but negative feedback, but it sure feels that way, since no one feels the need to write when things are going the way they like. They only write when they have something to complain about.  
  
Therefore, I would like to start BE NICE TO CARTOONISTS WEEK. This week, go to the site for the comics you like, and look for that email link, and send a nice email letting the author know how much you like their comic. That's it. Just a nice email with no critisisms. You'd be amazed at the effect a nice fan mail has on a cartoonist's motivation, especially less popular comics that don't get much feedback.  
  
If you feel like spreading the word, please cut and paste these paragraphs onto your website, or just write up your own.
