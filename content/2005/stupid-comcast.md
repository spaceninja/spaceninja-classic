So last night I was supposed to do all sorts of things on the internet like look at porn fix Pat's blog, but I was unable to do anything, because stupid Comcast had some sort of stupid "global connectivity problem" that they were "aware of" and "trying to fix".

Actually, I haven't had any serious problems with Comcast so far, and in comparison to Qwest, they're shining examples of efficiency - but that didn't make it any less frustrating to be unable to check my email all night.
