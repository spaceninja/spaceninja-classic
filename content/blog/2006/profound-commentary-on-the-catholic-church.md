> I have been working as a nanny to make money. The two little baby girls are 3 months and 18 months old. The older one is just starting to say words, so I ask her questions like, "Do you think Catholic priests should be allowed to marry?" and she shrieks and pokes me in the eye and says hi, which I find to be a profound answer and commentary on the state of the Catholic church. The younger one cannot talk yet, so we just go out drinking together to avoid awkward pauses, or we ride dirt bikes. Her motor control isn't great, so I worry about her steering and braking abilities, but she has been doing alright so I will probably let her try some jumps soon.
