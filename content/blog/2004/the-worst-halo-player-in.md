"\[The worst Halo player in the Bungie office\] would have to be Bernie, our graphics programmer. He spends too much time critiquing the way that the artists used bump-maps on the environment, and often you'll just find him standing in a corner flipping the flashlight on and off."
â€” Chris Butcher
