[![Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey](/images/1363960516_0907d816f5_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/1363960516/)

Rant is the newest book by Chuck Palahniuk, the Portland author who wrote Fight Club. The full title is Rant: An Oral Biography of Buster Casey, and it really feels like you're watching a documentary. The style is an interesting change of pace, and made for some fun reading, but the story itself was disappointing. The characters being interviewed for the book tell the story in chronological order, but they constantly reference things that happen in the future, which makes the plotline feel more complicated than it is - which would be forgivable if the plot twist wasn't so _lame_. The twist in Fight Club really pulled the rug out from under me, and for weeks after seeing the movie, my friends and I would remember little moments and go "Oh! It was all there if you knew what to look for!" But the twist in Rant is so far outside the realm of what you could imagine that it's not a twist so much as a bit of _Deus ex Machina_ to resolve and/or cause some of the stranger parts of the story. In the end, you're left with a bizarre story about a character that you can't relate to, and don't really care about. Oh, and also? Chuck Palahniuk has a really gross sense of humor. All that stuff from Fight Club about peeing in soup and stuff is apparently a running theme.
