Well, I guess I shouldn't have posted so quickly.  
  
1) Fojar upgrade was much more difficult than expected. After four hours, Steve thought we had the hard drives copied successfully and the server was up and running again to the point where he could return home.  
  
2) Where he could work on his cute new computer... that Win2K was refusing to recognize, and try to avoid doing a complete reinstall.  
  
3) Meanwhile, I returned home with one of the 4GB drives and started installing Mandrake Linux on it. Right after formatting the drive, I got a call from Steve asking if I had used the drive yet. Turns out the 4GB he gave me was the master drive, with everyone's email on it. Luckily, nothing had been written to the disk yet, so he might be able to get around the format job and recover, but we're still not sure what's happening with that.
