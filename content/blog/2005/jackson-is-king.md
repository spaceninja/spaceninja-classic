Right now, I should have just been getting home from seeing _King Kong_. We got our tickets online almost a week ago, and a whole group of us were going to go. Unfortunately, I caught a cold which hit me like a ton of bricks a few days ago, and I'm only just now starting to feel human again. I still wanted to go, but I think everyone around me would have gotten tired of me coughing and blowing my nose through all the dramatic scenes.

I was prepared to sit at home and watch some DVDs while everyone else went, but at the last minute, it started snowing, and one by one, everyone else decided not to go. Annie and Sean were the last ones to give in, but even they had to reconsider the idea when Annie's brakes started acting a bit funny in the cold.

A couple weeks ago, I got the 1933 version of _King Kong_ to watch before we went to the new one. I was surprised at how well it held up. Aside from the effects looking dated, and the 1930 acting style seeming a bit forced, the storyline was genuinely good, and you actually do view Kong as a character, rather than an effect. Walking away from it, I could see why everyone made such a bit deal of it, but I probably wouldn't have watched it again or given it much further thought other than as a jumping-off point for Jackson's remake.

That all changed when the special features disc arrived. It was perfect timing, really, since I wasn't up for anything more challenging than lying on the couch watching stuff. Even so, I was surprised by the quality of the two documentaries included on the disc.

The first was an hour-long bit called "I'm King Kong," about Merian C. Cooper, the director of _King Kong_ whose real life rivals Indiana Jones. He flew a biplane bomber in World War I, nearly died in a horrible plane crash that left his hands scarred for life, was taken prisoner by the Germans, flew a biplane to defend the Poland from the Russians, nearly died in another plane crash, was taken prisoner by the Russians, escaped a Russian work camp, returned to the US and started making movies with a friend he met during the war, assisted an army fighter squadron as a tactician during World War II even though he was over the age of service, made _King Kong_, and promoted the use of widescreen, stopmotion, and technicolor in movies. Needless to say, the guy's life is pretty startling, and the documentary features interviews with army generals, Fay Wray, Ray Harryhousen, and even voiceovers from the man himself.

The second documentary is the real goldmine, though. It's called "The Making of King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World," and it is just like watching the special features on the extended _Lord of the Rings_ movies. There's an excellent reason for that - it appears that it was made by Peter Jackson and his crew. It features tons of interviews and bits about the making of the movie, but it also features extended information on the special effects, soundtrack and sound effects, and what made them so groundbreaking. I didn't understand until I watched this just how much of the stuff in Kong had never been done before.

The coolest bit for me, however, was when they talked about how the stopmotion effects were done. There was so much secrecy around the making of Kong that there is no footage of the stopmotion and no interviews with the animation crew. In effect, Jackson pulled aside a group at Weta and told them that in addition to working on the new movie, they were going to reverse engineer the entire process used for the stopmotion, and recreate a scene that was cut from the movie and has never been found.

So there's nearly an hour of documentary just talking to the guys at Weta about building armatures and miniatures, the tricks that were used to create certain shots, and how they had to figure this all out from old diagrams and the final film reels. In the end, they film an entire missing scene (the legendary "Spider Pit" scene) and present it as an extra. Jackson in fact goes out of his way to tell other fans that this is by no means definitive, it's just his particular group's attempt to recreate the scene, which is why they didn't edit it back into the movie. They just made it for fun.

As far as I'm concerned, Jackson should get as much credit for his DVD extras as he does for his movies. He has set the standard for the way special editions of DVDs should work, and it's nice to see that his gold touch isn't limited to his own movies. Thanks to his special features, I now understand and appreciate the 1933 _King Kong_ better than I did before, and I can't wait to see his remake.

Which I should be able to do in a week or so, when I'm over this cold and the roads aren't covered with ice (and idiot drivers).
