There are three immediate effects springing from Steve and I taking a trip to Fry's last night to gain some new hardware for the ailing fojar server.

1. Steve gained a cute tiny little computer, which he will no doubt post photos of.

2. This new computer means Steve can donate his existing computer to the Fojar cause, meaning Fojar will have very stable hardware, for about the first time ever.

3. The hard drive swapping this will result in means that I gain a 4GB hard drive, which means I can finally get the third computer up and running and have a Linux box!

HOORAY!
