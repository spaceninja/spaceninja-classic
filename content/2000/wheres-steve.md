Some of you may have noticed that it's mostly Miles and myself posting here, and that Steve has barely said anything at all.

Why is this, you might be asking yourself? Could it be because Steve runs his own server, lives a fast lifestyle in california, and maintains about a dozen other websites, most of which he also doesn't post to very frequently? Perhaps he just doesn't like talking?

No, none of these answers are correct. The truth of the matter is that "Steve" is a simple PHP script that Miles and I wrote. He doesn't actually exist. We don't let the script post very often because it doesn't sound entirely like a real person, and it uses excessive punctuation. Miles has been trying to find that bug for over a year now, even though the popularity of Pokey the Penguin is almost entirely due to that bug.

So why are we coming forward with the truth now? Well, Miles and I are tired of living a lie. And more importantly, we're tired of "Steve" getting all the credit for everything. "I created Fojar! I made Pokey! I'm responsible for Hatelife!!!!!!!JA:LKDJFAAAAA" (see, you can see the script break down there after 'hatelife').

Miles and I wrote the code for "Steve" and then allowed it to create websites at random. We registered several domain names in it's name. We had no way of knowing that a simple program could get this big an ego.
