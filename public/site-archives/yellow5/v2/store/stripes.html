<P>Not pictured here, the deluxe auto-striper allows you to quickly and easily perform major striping jobs, including, but not limited to, city streets, parks, any flat surface you need striped! Similar to the models used by the Department of Transportation here in the state of Oregon, this striper can perform its duties at cruising speeds of up to 30 mph. A driver's license may be required for use in your area. The cost for this striping wonder of the 21st century is a paltry $100,000! Comes with a full supply of striping paint (good for one major job), AM/FM stereo, a handy dashboard compass to help you stripe, and a free 1 hour striping instructional session. Will be hand-delivered to your door.

<P>To order stripes, please send a check or money order for the cost of the stripes plus shipping and handling to:

<P>Yellow Number Five
<BR>2102 N. Walnut #71
<BR>Ellensburg, WA 98926

<P>Make checks out to the band's manager, Scott Vandehey, not Yellow Number Five. Please specify the kind of stripes you wish to buy. Allow 4-6 weeks for delivery.
