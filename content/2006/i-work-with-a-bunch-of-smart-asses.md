Yesterday I left work early because I wasn't feeling well. I sent out this email:

> I'm heading home early - something I ate isn't agreeing with me.

One of my coworkers responded with this:

> Scott, "I think the French are a sophisticated culture." Sandwich, "You are wrong. The French degrade the very foundations of democracy the modern world is striving to achieve." Scott, "That seems like a very obtuse statement." Sandwich, "Think what you want, traitor." Drink, "No wait, I think Scott has a valid point."

I've never felt more at home at a company in my life.
