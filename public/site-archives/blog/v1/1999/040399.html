<P>4.3.99
<BR>OH MY GOD!!! oh jeez... So Good... SO SO SO GOOD!!! ahhhh... I just returned from seeing the Matrix. Okay, forget EVERYTHING anyone's ever said to you about Keanu not being able to act. Forget all the crap people say about disappointing sci-fi special effects films. This movie will blow you away. SO GOOD!! I can't beleive it. "Guns. We need lots of guns." "I know kung-fu!" The movie has the perfect balance of just enough philosophy, action/gunfights, martial arts, and sci-fi stuff. It's just incredibly good. I talked to all these people who said "yeah, it's pretty good." Fuck that. This movie IS good. No qualifiers.

<P>I'm still just shaking my head at how cool it is. Let's see if I can remember other stuff that happened. Yesterday was rocking. In Pagans & Christians (which is a great class, by the way), we discussed sacrifice and what it meant to the greeks. After class, I came home and started on the KMFDM-style drawings for Mutton Kombat. Then I went to the team meeting for the computer labs, so I got pizza, then I hung out at work and killed time until the movie night started! I was stoked, because Mark was showing Pi and Cube. But then Pi didn't get there, so he said we were going to watch Seven Samurai instead, which was cool, since I want to see that, but then Pi got there at the last minute, so we switched back! Steve (who turned 21 last night) brought a bottle of whiskey, and Miles brought vodka. I had a few sips of whiskey, and a nice strong screwdriver, plus another shot of vodka after that. Cube came first, and it was a disappointment. It has a horrible ending. Then we watched Pi, which is great. The ending isn't quite as cool as it could have been, but the rest of the movie was great.

<P>Nice loud industrial music jamming, and he's narrating along with the beat while walking around. "3:15... restate my assumptions... there are patterns... 3:25... press return." Very cool movie. Makes you all excited about math and computers and stuff. We all ran back to the labs (Miles very drunk, me getting there, and Steve hardly at all). We started recording sound effects for Mutton Kombat, including a GREAT version of the Mutton Kombat theme song with all of us singing together. Then Steve left, but he left the whiskey, which Miles and I finished off, and, nicely drunk, we continued recording stuff. Not related to Mutton, but just great random stuff that I'm sure we'll regret when we listen sober, but we've vowed not to edit them too much. The fact that you can hear three drunk guys making bear noises with snickering in the background is perfect for Mutton Kombat.

<P>Finally at about 3am, Miles and I admitted we wanted to sleep, and he crashed on my couch. About seven hours later, we all got up, and Miles and I wandered downtown with the intention of seeing Matrix, which Aaron assured us was pretty good (understatement of the day). I bought the Pi soundtrack, and the movies From Dusk Till Dawn, and Flash Gordon. Then we saw Matrix, which was so awesome, I bought the soundtrack, and I'm listening to it now.

<P>Oh man. This is gonna be a great weekend!
