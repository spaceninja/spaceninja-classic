<big>Interview with Leo Beazley</big>
<br>8/28/1999
<br><small>Reprinted without permission from <i>Blister</i>.</small>

<P>Blister: Leo, thank you for taking time to do this interview.

<P>Leo: Oh, you're more than welcome! I'm having fun! And besides, who turns down free drinks?

<P>B:  Right. Tell us a little something about what Y5 is working on right now.

<P>L: Well, as you know, our label has delayed the release of our new album indefinitely, so we've started working on a side project I've been interested in pursuing. Right now I'm calling it Klassikally Yellow, but the band's trying to talk me out of it. These are instrumental pieces, continuing to experiment with a vein that Colossus was experimenting with when he died.

<P>B: You're referring to taking classical music and adding a techno beat to it?

<P>L: Well, [chuckles] there's more to it than that, but yes. We see it as recreating the classics using our modern music skills. Right now we're working on a really great piece using bagpipe music.

<P>B: Has there been tension in the band following your filling in the vacancy Dr. Colossus left?

<P>L: Oh, I don't know. I don't think so� We all seem to get along pretty well. I mean sometimes practice ends early because David is stoned again and Big Ed and Amy are having sex, but for the most� um, could you cut that part?

<P>B: No.

<P>L: Oh� um, well naturally I mean "stoned" and "sex" as analogies for completely legal and moral activities.

<P>B: Does the band engage in completely moral and legal activities frequently?

<P>L: Oh yeah� [nodding] I mean, HEY! No� er� Say, did you hear about Dr. Colossus's head appearing over Mt. Rushmore?

<P>B: Yeah, I saw a report on that. What was the band's take on it?

<P>L: For the most part they're ignoring it. I heard about it through a fan when I was checking our email, and when I told them about it, they all looked kinda sheepish. I've been trying to get them to do a s�ance with me to try and talk to Colossus about life in the beyond, but none of them want to. Still, I think it'd be pretty rad.

<P>B: Well that's all the time I have� thank you for the interview!

<P>L: Anytime! Thanks for the drinks!
