<P><big>Yellow Number Five Has New Lead Singer.</big>
<br><small>Blurb from <I>Blister</I> magazine.</small>

<P>Yellow Number Five has a new lead singer. Leo Beazly, a Portland resident and former full-time gas station attendant has assumed the position recently opened following the death of Dr. Colossus.

<P>"We actually found him at PSU," says "Big" Ed Stockman, a member of the band. "We were visiting a friend at a party, and we found him in the back room at the karaoke machine, singing a perfect rendition of Funky Town."

<P>"It was eerie," replied David Meyers, fellow bandmate. "After hearing him sing, we knew we had to get him to join. It wasn't too difficult, once we told him we'd pay him over minimum wage."

<P>A new album is due out before April, tentativly called "Woman of Steel." It contains all new material from the band, in contrast to the albums comprised entirely of cover songs they released before.

<P>"We were already headed in that direction before Colossus killed himself," says Ed. "The Sinner single, for example, was almost entirely our own stuff. We had plans to release an entire album, but then the whole thing with Colossus happened, so it got put on hold."

<P>"This album is a sort of transitional thing for us," said Amy Johnson, the other band member. "Most of the songs are from our time with Colossus, but a few are brand new, some are in reaction to his death, and some are just redone with Leo singing."

<P>And what does Leo have to say about all this?
<BR>"It's been a great experience. I love being in the band. Plus, it's nice to finally not have my hands stink of gasoline."
