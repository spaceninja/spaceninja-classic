If you're like me, you're really looking forward to the new game that Will Wright is working on, called Spore. It's basically "SimEverything" - you start out as a microscopic organism, evolve until you get larger and larger, leave the oceans, become sentient, form a culture, build a village, grow to a city, take over the planet, expand through the solar system, and eventually explore other systems and galaxies - which are populated with content from other players' games. The demo he ran at the 2005 GDC has finally surfaced online, and you can now watch a [a 30-minute demo guided by Will Wright](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&q=spore), which is good, since the [official website](http://www.spore.com/) isn't very interesting yet.

**Followup:** One more video (maybe the same thing, I haven't watched yet), an hour-long video of [Will Wright discussing Spore](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-262774490184348066&q=will+wright+spore).
