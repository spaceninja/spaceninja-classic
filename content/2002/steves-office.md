i haven't slept well in months. my room is large and the walls are empty, except for a few photographs of stephanie and me, an arrangement of leaves my sister gave me when i moved to california, a whiteboard, and a chinese painting on fabric (red fabric, which signifies a good life - it was probably intended as a birthday-gift painting).

my living room has the following items of note: bartok's duets for violin (44 tunes in two books), an old speaker designed by henry kloss in use as a coffee table (books: the latin translation of winnie the pooh, the tao te ching), and toys my dog likes to play with.

the kitchen has one of the neatest items i've obtained in a long time- [this oriental tea set](http://fojar.com/~steve/pics/teaset.jpg). it was a christmas gift from stephanie, whom i still love dearly and whose presence and warmth and company i miss every day we're apart. i haven't had a chance to cook myself a gourmet chinese meal since my return, but when i do so i will employ my rice cooker, my 22" wok, and my chinese tea set.
