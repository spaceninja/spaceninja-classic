YAAY! KMorg is back! My domain! I missed it so much!

So, let's see... lots of stuff happened while the site was down that I wanted to post...

First and foremost, the [Halo 2 Teaser Trailer](http://halo.bungie.org/misc/halo2trailermirrors.html) has been released to the public, and it is SWEET.

> "Halo 2 is a lot like Halo 1, only it's Halo 1 on fire, going 130 miles per hour through a hospital zone, being chased by helicopters and ninjas... And the ninjas are all on fire, too."
> \- Jason Jones, Bungie Studios

Secondly, I found a link to [Jeff Vogel's "The Story About The Baby"](http://www.ironycentral.com/babymain.html), which is hilarious in a way that makes you feel kind of bad for laughing.

> "Whenever I've just put on a fresh diaper, before dressing her again, she is invariably happy. Blissed out. She kicks her legs up, and airs out her parts, and she couldn't be more pleased. Oddly enough, when I try this, it doesn't work. After using the bathroom, I rubbed myself down thoroughly with moist towelettes, took off my pants, hopped into bed, and kicked my legs in the air. It really made me feel free and fresh, but not happy. I had my wife come in and rub my belly. No help. I had her moo at me. While this intrigued me in a way neither of us are comfortable with, no extra happiness. My legs hurt. My back hurt. While my kid can hold that position forever, I had to lower my legs. And, eventually, I put on pants."

Lately, when I haven't been working, or laughing until I cry reading that site, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto III, NeverWinter Nights, and WarCraft III. I was starting to feel bad about how much time I was spending playing games, until last night, when Sean came over and spent 11 hours playing Jet Set Radio Future on the Xbox. He started playing around midnight, and he only stopped about an hour ago to take a shower. In the time he was playing, he went from being a little behind where Miles and I were in the game to being about 300 levels ahead of us.

I'm sure there's other stuff, but I can't remember it right now. I'll post more later.
