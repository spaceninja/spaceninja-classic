Man, talk about good timing! The last few weeks, I've been reading about how WordPress, which was at version 1.2.2 was going to be upgraded to version 1.5 very very soon. But I didn't know how soon that was, and so I was preparing to switch all my blogs to 1.2.2 and then upgrade later.

Today, 1.5 was released. That's right, the very day I finished with my portfolio and was starting to look into wordpress upgrades, the new version comes out. How cool is that?
