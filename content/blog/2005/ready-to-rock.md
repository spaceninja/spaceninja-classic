I'm ready! I've spent the last several days doing my research and prepwork, and the next big project (after finishing the damn portfolio - tomorrow, I swear!) is to move all my sites over to the new webhost - and at the same time to convert them to WordPress. I've been really worried about this switch, thinking it's going to be a huge pain, but I'm feeling much more confident now, and I while I'm still sure it will be a lot of work, I can do it over time and still get this server move accomplished.
