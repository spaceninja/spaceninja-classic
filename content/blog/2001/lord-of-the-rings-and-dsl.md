Well, tonight is the night that KT and Sean and Annie and Zach and I all go see Lord of the Rings. Steve wasn't able to get tickets in time, and [he made me promise not to tell him about the movie](/site-archives/hammerspace/v2/).

Yesterday my DSL _finally_ came online. My original 10 business day installation period ballooned up to five weeks, with more screw-ups on Qwest's part than I can count. They got my ISP wrong (twice), they got my account wrong (640kps instead of 256kps), they never called me when anything was wrong, they were resistant to making changes. It was just a horrible experience. I'm tempted to make a [powerpoint presentation about the quality of their service](http://www.snopes2.com/business/info/badhotel/frame.htm).

About the only positive experience I've had has been with my ISP, [DSLnorthwest](http://www.dslnorthwest.net/), who have gone out of their way to make everything simple and easy for me.

But the ability to work from home really makes it all worth it (in the abstract sense... I still hate Qwest). My alarm went off at 9:50 this morning. I rolled out of bed, brushed my teeth, and walked to work... in the next room. It's fantastic. And of course, having a static IP address means I can do neat stuff like [stream music from my computer](http://radio.spaceninja.com:8000/). I'll probably be leaving this stream on all the time, so if you're ever interested in what music I'm playing, just point your winamp at \[[http://radio.spaceninja.com:8000](http://radio.spaceninja.com:8000/)\].

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Due to changes in the law, I stopped the radio broadcast shortly after posting this, and it's no longer available.
