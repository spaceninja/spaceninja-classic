There's a great article on the potential difficulties facing us CSS advocates in the coming years over on [Digital Web Magazine](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/a_matter_of_styles/).

> After about ten minutes, Eustace is cursing softly under his breath: what should have been a simple find-and-replace has turned into a tedious editing job. Rorshach’s style sheets total nearly three thousand lines of code—and by now, Eustace is all too aware of how many different developers currently maintain them. His find-and-replace dreams were quashed by more methods of color notation than he’d care to think about: some of the application’s developers prefer to write `#003366` in its entirety; others are fans of the terse `#036`; a few sadistic souls apparently ditched hex notation altogether, and opted for `rgb(0, 102, 153)`. And by the time he got to this:
>
> `.classOne {   color: #003366;   font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;   font-weight: bold; }`
>
> `.classTwo {   color: #CC0000;   font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;   font-weight: bold; }`
>
> `.classThree {   color: #006633;   font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;   font-weight: bold; }`
>
> …well, it’s enough to make a junior developer run home, close all the drapes, and have a good cry while listening to Depeche Mode in the dark.
