Here's the new design! It's not entirely done yet, and the sub-pages all need a lot more work, but I was tired of looking at the ugly temporary design. Over the coming days, I'll be putting in more work cleaning it up and making it work better, but the basics are here for your viewing pleasure.

The plan is to get the underlying HTML cleaned up to give a solid base to work on, and then all of my designs will be contained in the CSS files, and it will be really easy to change designs without having to change the code.

GEEK DETAILS: I'm very proud of the basic layout code. If you peek at the [CSS file](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/blog/v4/style.css), you'll see I've split it up into three sections - Layout, Design, and Blog. The Layout styles are very simple, and just put the plain HTML into the traditional sidebar layout you see here. The Design styles are some rules that define page design, like the background files and colors. The Blog styles are rules that define the typography and other little tweaks that make the blog look better (like the background colors for comments and outlines around the author icons).
