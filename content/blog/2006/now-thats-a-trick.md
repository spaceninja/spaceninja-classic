Magician David Copperfield [fooled a robber at gunpoint](http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2006/04/25/0425copperfield.html) into believing he had nothing to steal. "...He pulled out all of his pockets for Riley to see he had nothing, even though he had a cellphone, passport and wallet stuffed in them."

Now, that's awesome. Although I think it's funny that he couldn't do anything to stop the robbers from stealing everything the "two young ladies" had (though they got it back later when the guys were arrested).
