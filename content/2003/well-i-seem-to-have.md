Well, I seem to have gotten over the worst of my cold (thank goodness), and I feel prepared to start doing things again (for the past week, I've done basically nothing but sit in the living room watching Stargate SG-1 tapes and feeling miserable).  
  
Of course, that means that I basically feel like I'm a week behind, and I have a ton of stuff to do. Aside from work for my real job, I also have the half-finished KMorg upgrade to finish, two more CD designs for crunchpod (the first one just came back from press, and Ben says it looks good, I should have copies soon!), and several other side projects that I won't even mention because I shouldn't even be working on them until those first two are finished.  
  
Plus, I'm completely addicted to StarGate SG-1 now. It's amazing how good a sci-fi series they managed to spin off from an otherwise mediocre movie. Over the last week, I've watched probably 30 episodes, covering the first season and a half, and I want more. Luckily, it's on TV pretty frequently, so I should be able to get my fix without trying too hard.  
  
Oh, and have I mentioned that I'm completely obsessed with CSS lately? I've spent a good portion of my free time (before I got sick) researching the best way to produce various layouts using CSS, the relative merits of the browser-upgrade campaign hidden message, how to simulate HTML table effects using CSS, and why web standards are a Good Thing.  
  
So in the last week, I've conquered illness, developed an addiction, furthered an obsession and managed to thoroughly procrastinate any real work.  
  
I fluctuate between being proud of myself and feeling terribly, terribly guilty.
