i saw two great local acts tonight. the first was gypsy cab, which has my friend eddie as fiddler. they've got the django sound \_perfected\_ .. i likes em. i hear that music and i don't want to play anything else.  
  
then i went down to jimmy mak's and heard a great jazz act, complete with hammond b3! swoon! i even bought their cd.. but, again.. i hear that music and i don't want to play anything else. maybe i just fall in love too easily. ;)
