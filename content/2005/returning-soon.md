Okay, so the first week of work was a bit overwhelming, what with the multiple-hours-of-commuting (compared to the 20 feet I was used to), but all in all, it went well, and I will resume posting shortly.

On a side note, is anyone having trouble with the site, or commenting? I've heard a few troubling remarks, but I haven't seen any evidence of it, personally. If you can't comment, drop me an email.

**Update:** When in doubt, blame Internet Explorer. When I open the site in IE, it looks fine. But when I go to a permalink page (such as when I want to comment) the page comes up blank. I'll work on this. In the meantime, \*cough\*[GetABetterBrowser](http://browsehappy.com/)\*cough\* oh, excuse me... just bear with me and I'll have the problem fixed shortly.

On another side note, what do you people do for lunch at work? I don't want to spend money on lunch everyday, but I can't think of very many things to brown-bag to work besides sandwiches, which will get old fast. I have access to a fridge, microwave, and watercooler/hot-water-dispenser thingy.
