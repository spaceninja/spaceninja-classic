So our finances just got a much-needed shot in the arm, in the form of our tax refunds. My uncle called and read me a nice high number for our federal tax refund. It's higher than I've ever gotten before, but that's partly to be expected, since this is the first year Annie and I are filing jointly, and her educational credits are very helpful.

The Multnomah County tax happens to come to about the same amount as our state tax refund, so I can just cancel the two out in my mind.

But the great thing is that our federal tax refund is large enough that it will pay off the last bits of my Apple loan, pay off two of our credit cards, and even set a bit aside in savings for Annie's graduation present!

And with all the debt that accumulates interest shoved out of the way, I'll be able to start paying off my debt to Mom and Dad earlier than expected, and with luck that debt will be paid off in June!

Why is this posted in the "politics" section? Well, taxes are related to politics. Right? Right? What?
