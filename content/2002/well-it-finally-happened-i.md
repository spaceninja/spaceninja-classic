Well, it finally happened. I got so fed up with the security flaws, and the random unfixable errors that I've quit using Internet Explorer. Now that Mozilla hit 1.0, I've been using it off and on, but still using IE for my day-to-day browsing. But I just can't take it anymore. There are too many dumb flaws, and inexplicable conflicts. The thing that finally pushed me over the edge, however, is POP-UP WINDOWS. I hate these more than I can put into words. They're the browser equivalant to spam. I understand these websites need to raise money to support themselves, but why pop-ups? When it got to the point where I couldn't look at [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/) without wanting to hurt something, I decided to switch. And why's that? Because Mozilla has one feature that no other major (PC) browser has, not even the Netscape 6 or 7 versions which are based on Mozilla... You can disable popups! Now I am browsing the web and enjoying life again! Thanks, [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/)!
