I just saw the D&D movie!

1. the Dwarf is bigger than anyone else in the group.
2. the Elf wears a steel breast-plate — with nipples!
3. one Thief can't climb walls, the other one takes down Fighters with regularity.
4. they all talk like table-top gamers — HOORAY!
5. PARTICLE EFFECTS
6. "Staff of dragon control" is 2' long.
7. Lack of [busty axewomen](http://isometric.sixsided.org/_/the_vernacular) ironic!

I could say more but that would entail spoilers! You all go see it! now, please!
