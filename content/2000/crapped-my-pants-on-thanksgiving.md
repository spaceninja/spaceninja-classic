Last year I went to Seattle for thanksgiving. My girlfriend and I were visiting her family in Tacoma, and then got on a bus to go to Seattle to meet my parents for thanksgiving day. I felt alright when I got on the bus. I had felt a little odd when I got up that morning, but nothing that would prevent me from getting on the 45-minute bus ride. Within five minutes I knew I had made a horrible mistake. But it was too late to do anything. All I could do was sit there and pray that the bus would miraculously pull up to a public restroom. I had my eyes shut tight and I was curled up in a ball next to my girlfriend focusing all my energy on not losing complete control of my body. I felt sure that if I stopped focusing on this for even a second, horrible things would erupt from every body cavity I have. After approximately 20 years, the bus pulled into Westlake Mall. I bounded off the bus and had to drag my girlfriend away from some people she was trying to give directions to. She was irritated that I had done that, having no idea the emergency situation I was in. I think I muttered something about not having any time and hauled her up the stairs. The mall was within sight, and that meant restrooms. She seemed to have caught on to my situation and was taking me as quickly as we could walk. About 50 feet into the mall all my concentration was for nothing. I lost all control of my body. The worst feeling in the world is walking through a crowded public place and crapping your pants. I was almost crying. My body had betrayed me. I was trying so hard, and it wasn't hard enough. My girlfriend kept taking me in the right direction, and then I headed into the restroom. I did my best to clean up. Miraculously, the damage was mostly contained in my boxers. I cleaned myself up the best I could, and pulled my pants back on. They were only slightly soiled. I left a pair of horribly befouled boxers lying on the floor of a stall in Westlake mall for some poor janitor to discover later. I was in no mental state to deal with them. I made Annie take me to some store and buy me a new pair of pants. I threw the other pair away and we went to meet my parents at their hotel. By the time we got there, I was feeling much better, and actually ended up going to a movie and dinner with them. I have no idea what brought this horrible event upon me, whether it was some really brief illness, or if I ate something really bad for me. But I can safely say that the feeling of my body betraying me that short a distance from the restroom was the worst feeling I had ever had.
