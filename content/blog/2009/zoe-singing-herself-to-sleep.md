Don't worry about the fact that you can't see anything in the video - it was taken in Zoe's room with the lights out, while Annie tried to put Zoe to bed one night.

For several nights in a row, I had been laughing while listening to Annie try to put Zoe to bed. She would lay Zoe down, and then sit next to the crib, rubbing her back and quietly singing songs.

Sounds great, except as you can hear, Zoe insisted on singing along. Finally, it got so funny that I asked Annie to sneak the camera in one night so we could record Zoe "singing herself to sleep."
