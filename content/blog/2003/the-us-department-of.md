The US Department of Homeland Security has provided us with a [handy website](http://www.ready.gov/get_informed.html) containing many tips about what to do if exposed to various forms of terrorist attacks, including useful tips like [running away from nuclear explosions](http://www.ready.gov/nuclear_visual.html) and not [breathing in chemical fumes](http://www.ready.gov/biological_visual2.html) or [playing with dead animals](http://www.ready.gov/chemical_visual.html).

The site is suprisingly well-designed, though it has [inspired](http://www.idlewords.com/biological.html) [some](http://www.idlewords.com/chemical.html) [clever](http://www.idlewords.com/explosions.html) [parodies](http://www.idlewords.com/nuclear_blast.htm) [already](http://www.idlewords.com/radiation.html). (that's five links there, not one big one)

And in related news, [Sir Isaac Newton says that the world will end in 2060](http://news.excite.com/odd/article/id/304718|oddlyenough|02-24-2003%3A%3A10%3A25|reuters.html).
