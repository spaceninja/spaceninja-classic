I haven't felt much like blogging lately, but lots has been happening.

Annie's last week of work ended on Friday. Now she can focus on packing for the next week, and continue looking for a job in Washington.

My work situation continues to be strange, but I don't feel like getting into that. Email me if you want details.

We went to go see _Shawn Of The Dead_ with Eric, Jill, Jeff and Sean, and it was awesome. I also saw _Resident Evil 2_ a week or two ago, so it's like Zombie Movie Month or something.

Yesterday Annie and I drove up to our new apartment and signed the paperwork and wrote a check for first-month's rent. The lease agreement was about five pages long, and a little worrying, but I didn't see any obvious dangers in it, aside from the danger of signing a six-month lease when I'm about to lose my job. Our apartment is in surprisingly good condition. Probably because the apartment manager lived there before us.

Qwest continues to suck rocks. I did a bit of math and found out that as bad as they suck, it would save us $50 a month to go with a landline and DSL instead of a cell phone and cable internet, so I was giving Qwest a chance. They were supposed to be able to tell me on Thursday, when the landline got connected, whether I could get DSL. On Friday, I found out that I cannot get DSL. For some reason, they CAN get it in the manager's office, but not our apartment.

The good news is that after I complained to a manager, she agreed that I shouldn't have to pay for the landline connection, since I was only getting it for DSL, so I shouldn't be charged at all for anything in Washington.

Our cable internet is getting installed on Sunday, but the only timeslot available is from 2-6pm, and we're not arriving until at least 5pm. Luckily, Mrs. Stockman graciously agreed to hang out at our apartment during that time so someone would be there when the cable guy arrives. We left her some folding chairs, a CD player and our tiny little TV to test the signal with.

Packing is proceeding at a good pace. We've already completely packed the dining room and my office, and Annie's office is half-done. Over the coming week, we'll be doing one room a night, and should get everything done in time to start loading the truck on Sunday morning.

Today, Mrs. Stockman is cooking brunch for the family and is then taking us to buy a new mattress set. My mother-in-law rules.

Anyways, I should quit typing now, because Oskar will be here soon, and I want to be ready to steal a few minutes with my studly nephew before the rest of the family arrives and wants to see him. Which reminds me I still need to post my photos of the boy... I'll do that when I get home.
