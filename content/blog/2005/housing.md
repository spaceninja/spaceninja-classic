Too tired to post more right now, but I thought I should mention that Annie and I have found a nice one-bedroom apartment here in Portland. It's on Hawthorne, and is pretty cool, plus the landlord is really nice, and willing to roll with our odd employment situation. Also, Eric and Jill found a house that they're going to rent, which they're moving into this weekend, so I'm going to be back into the moving craziness for the next week or two.
