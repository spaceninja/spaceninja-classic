Well, Annie and I bought our tickets for New York. We managed to catch a price break on http://www.travelocity.com/ and got the tickets for about $150 cheaper than all the other sites were charging.

Annie, Sean, and I will be flying out of [PDX](http://www.portlandairportpdx.com/) around noon on Wednesday 9/25, and getting into [LGA](http://www.panynj.gov/aviation/lgaframe.HTM) (La Guardia) just before midnight, after a 2 hour layover in [Chicago](http://www.ci.chi.il.us/).

While we're in New York we'll be staying at the lovely [YMCA](http://www.ymcanyc.org/ygny/YMCA.html?branch=greenpoint&body=greenpointabout&) next door to Ryan and Molli's place.

We'll be flying home from LGA a bit before noon on Sunday 9/29 and getting back into Portland at 2:30PM after a one hour layover in [St. Louis](http://stlouis.missouri.org/) (ah, the wonders of traveling backwards through time).

We'll be flying in one [Boeing 757](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/757family/) , but the other three flights are all in something called a McDonnell Douglas SP80 Jet. An internet search found no results, except for an [obscure reference on a discussion board](http://www.alaska261.org/wwwboard/messages/147.html) saying that the MD-SP80 is an extended version of the [MP80](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/md-80-90/), which looks to be a variant on a [DC-10](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/dc-10/background.html) (I love the internet).

I haven't been [on a plane](http://www.angelfire.com/ma2/danimal/humor/humor29.html) in years, so I'm kind of excited just about the flying, and on top of that, I've never been to Chicago or St Louis, so now I'll get to see as much of them as you can during a brief layover at a major airport.

Then once we get to New York, we'll get to see [Leilani](http://leilani.spaceninja.com/)! (oh, and Ryan and Molli too).
