Well, we're still working on it, but Rusted is like 90% converted over to Forum 5000!

**W00T!** Rusted is updated! We're now running the sweet sweet sweet program Forum 5000, with all the awesome power that implies. Actually, most of you won't notice the difference, but it's a huge improvement for us! Anyways, everything should be working again, including the ability to reply without an account. I'll be working on restoring all the old skins over the next week or two, so keep an eye on the [options](http://rusted.killingmachines.org/skin.php) page.

Still to fix:
\- anonymous replies (allow people to reply without having an account).
\- enable \[aside: that neat new feature from hatelife that lets you use seques, tangents and asides\]
\- fixing the other skins.
\- adding skin thumbnails to "options" page.
\- misc. small formatting tasks.
\- other stuff I can't remember

**Edit 10/26/2005:** The options page has been discontinued.
