Okay, I found some good plugins that let me get my basic stats (post and comment count) plus some extras, like total word count. Even better, on the same site, the "recent posts" plugin lets me give an offset list of posts, so I can get that back too! These plugins all came from [MtDewVirus.com](http://www.mtdewvirus.com/). Now I just need to check my archives and do some cleaning, and I'll be ready to plunge into the templates to get my nice clean XHTML back!
