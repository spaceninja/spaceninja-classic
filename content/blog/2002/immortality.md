I got this spam the other day:

> Today millions of people all over the world receive this letter.
>
> What we longed for and had a presentiment about - has happened. A doctor from Russia has discovered the secret of the "Elixir of Youth". Whether the pharmacological companies want it or not, mankind is faced with the fact - the secret of death is opened. Now everyone can fight with the illnesses by himself, - winning and prolonging the life, - not growing old!
>
> Tell your friends and relatives. The whole world should know about it. Details here: \[[http://long-life.shorturl.com](http://long-life.shorturl.com)\] OR \[[http://long-life.da.ru](http://long-life.da.ru)\]

Don't these foolish Russians realize that [the Chinese discovered the secret of immortality long ago](http://www.alexchiu.com/)? Silly Russians. Always lagging behind the times.
