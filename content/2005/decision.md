Okay, I've made my decision. Based on the comments I received and talking to Miles, I'm going to switch to TextDrive.com. Since they only allow three domain names on the basic plan, though, the time has come to trim some of the fat. I'll be hosting most of my stuff on TextDrive, and I may move some extra low-traffic domains over to nearlyfreespeech.net, as well as moving Sean's domain over there.

I'm also going to take this as the motivation I needed to convert the weblogs to WordPress, since MovableType has started sucking. My portfolio redesign is nearly done, so I'm going to focus on that tomorrow, and then start the transfer process over the weekend. Wish me luck!
