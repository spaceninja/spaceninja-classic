> "I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything I thought it could be." â€” Peter Gibbons, _Office Space_

That quote pretty much describes the last few weeks for me. You know, except for the whole putting everything we own into boxes and moving in 90 degree heat part. Other than that, it's been relaxed and easy. I haven't been on my computer much, except to play video games... So I guess what I meant to say is that I've been on my computer non-stop, but I haven't been doing web design or email or anything.

I've also been hanging out with Eric and Jill and watching a lot of movies. It's been wonderful. Between the last few weeks at my job, and packing and moving, I hadn't realized quite how stressed I've been, and taking this time for myself has really helped.

Tomorrow, I'm getting on a train and headed North for our anniversary camping trip with Dave & Rose and Urn & Kat. Once I get back from that, I'm going to start seriously apartment hunting, with the goal of finding a place by labor day, when Annie comes down. I'll also be starting on the job hunt, but I'm prepared for that to take a few months.

Anyways, sorry for not posting lately. I'll be gone over the weekend, and then I'm aiming to start posting regularly again, along with resuming personal web development.
