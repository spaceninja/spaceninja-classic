It snuck up on me this year, and this morning, I realized I hadn't planned a good [April](/2001/04/i-have-seen-the-light/) [Fool's](/2004/04/moving-to-new-york/) [Day](/2005/04/new-design/) for my website, so I just uploaded [my original "blog" from 1999](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/blog/v1/) for the day. Luckily, other people were better prepared.

- [Lifehacker](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/zombies/), [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/zombies/), [Kotaku](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/zombies/), and [Consumerist](http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/zombies/) all spent the day posting tips for surviving the Zombie apocalypse.
- The Register informed us that [China bought Google](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/01/china_buys_google/).
- Bungie gave us a [news post](http://bungie.com/News/TopStory.aspx?story=BngeWklyUpdteMar31&p=6540570) with a new screenshot of [Pimps At Sea](http://bungie.com/images/news/inlineimages/PASLive_firstscreen.jpg).
- Blizzard announced a new playable race for World of Warcraft: [The Wisps](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/wisps.html).
- and not to be outdone, Google announced a new set of tools called [Google Romance](http://www.google.com/romance/).

**Followup:**

- Google had another april fool's joke - they "leaked" their april fools site before the first, and then posted something else. [Google Rooms](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-04-01-n20.html) is still pretty funny, even if it was a fake-out.
- [Anil Dash is a grumpy old man](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/03/31/your_april_fool) who doesn't like to have fun.
- So is Waxy.org (though they seem to be tongue-in-cheek when they call it "[Internet Jackass Day](http://www.waxy.org/archive/2006/03/31/internet.shtml).")
- And, of course, Slashdot posted their [OMG!!! Ponies!!!](http://flickr.com/photos/avalonstar/122431398/) design.
