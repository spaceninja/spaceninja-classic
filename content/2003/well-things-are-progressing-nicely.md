Well, things are progressing nicely. The KMorg upgrade initiative continues to slowly creep towards the finish line, promising a better, more extensible product for the future. Once the www.KMorg upgrade is finished, I'll be upgrading Rusted as well.  
  
My copies of the first crunchpod CD arrived, and I couldn't be happier with the way it looks. This is easily the best work I've ever done, and seeing it professionally printed really excites me. I'm hoping to finish the KMorg upgrade quickly so I can devote the bulk of my spare time to finishing the design for the next two CDs.  
  
Today is Zach's birthday, and last night we threw him a suprise party (of sorts). We had a big spaghetti dinner, and then while Zach wasn't looking, we stuck a candle into the chocolate cake and brought it out to the table, where Zach looked completely shocked. He had no idea we were doing anything at all. He also seemed to like his present, a basic set of dishes and silverware that everyone chipped in for. Happy Birthday, Zach!  
  
This week, Annie's brother Dave is coming down to stay the night with on Tuesday, because he has a job interview in Vancouver on Wednesday morning. It'll be good to see him, and not just because he's bringing my copy of _Age of Mythology_ with him.
