<big>Low Self Esteem single - Arrakis Records</big>

<P>The Low Self Esteem single was released in December of 1997 from Arrakis records, in response to a public demand for more original Y5 songs, after the addition of an original track on Dr. Colossus Must Die!  All the songs are original Y5 material, with the exception of one Nine Inch Nails recreation.  Colossus said: "we included I Just Want Something I Can Always Have, because it isn't so much a remix or a cover as an entirely new song, using I Just Want Something I Can Never Have as a launchpad.  I wrote all the other songs, but that one grew out of listening to that NIN song over and over again one night... I just sort of rolled with the ideas that came to me.  So it's not an entirely original song, but it's not really a remix either." This album is highly available.  Look for a full length album of original Y5 tunes in Summer of 1998, tentatively called Sex Symbols.
