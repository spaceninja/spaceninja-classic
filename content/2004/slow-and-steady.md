I am making slow and steady progress towards my vision of what I want this website to be again. Tonight's progress is that I finally finished making some tweaks to the photoblog that were needed in order to provide two differently sized thumbnails for every photo - a small version for a "recent photos" sidebar to be used here on the blog, and a larger thumbnail for use on the front page of the photoblog itself.

I've been holding off on doing any web design work on the photoblog or even starting to post to it because I was working on the best solution for the thumbnail issue. Now that I've found it, I'm hoping to make good progress on it.

And once my photoblog is up and running, I can easily copy the same setup for Sean over on [nyarlo](http://nyarlo.net/).
