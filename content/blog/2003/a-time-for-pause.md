oh man!

forum 5000 is about one week's worth of work away from being not only the best piece of software i've ever written, but probably pretty close to the best forum system out there. it's got a really flexible text-processing system \[aside: like the code that does this\], a pretty remarkable preference system (allowing any item in the system to have any # of preferences affixed to it), it's the only discussion board with revision control, it's the only one that lets you save working drafts of your entries. go steve and scott!

my birthday is coming up in a few weeks!!

(april 2nd! i'm going to be **twenty five** :( )

but i'm happy with my life..the last few months have opened some pretty remarkable doors. my work with f5k, getting caught up in some of the very well-paying freelance work (which i haven't been doing enough of, but hopefully with F5K nearing completion that'll change), certainly my musicianship. it's been a good 25 years! here's to at least 25 more!
