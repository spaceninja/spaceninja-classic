So my new job is pretty cool. It's computer stuff, and graphics stuff, and after two months with no hope of a job, it's about 100 times cooler than I was expecting any job I got to be. My coworkers seem a little strange, but overall pretty cool. Once we're all more comfortable together, I'm sure it'll be cool.

The dirty details, for those of you who are interested: I'm making $7.50 an hour to begin with, and they said if they like my work, I'll be getting a raise soon. I'm working full-time, 8:30 to 5:30 on weekdays. The store is closed on weekends and major holidays. I think she said we get paid vacation days, and after I've worked for three months, I'll qualify for health insurance and two weeks paid vacation!

Also, Annie got a job. She doesn't know much about it yet, except when she's working, but even if she's making minimum wage, the two of us will be pulling in enough to money to live very comfortably. I'll finally be able to buy some CDs, we can pay off the couch, and we can look into purchasing some technology, like a webcam, DVD player, bigger TV or a digital camera. I'm pretty excited.
