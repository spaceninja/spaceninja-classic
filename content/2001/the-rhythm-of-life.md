Well, Scott and I are off to eastern Wa tomorrow for a wedding and to visit friends and family... Let's all pray we make it back safely, for as we know, PEOPLE KEEP FUCKING DYING OVER THERE!

On the upside, for the three people I know who died this year, three I know were born. Twin boys I'm helping take care of, and early Thursday morning a friend of mine had a beautiful baby boy. I was there and got to see him when he was like 30 min. old. crazy. I also just found out that the three cousins of mine that are recently married are all expecting babies early next year.

You gotta wonder about the timing of three people dying and three being born all in one summer. The whole idea of a rhythm of life really starts to make sense when stuff like that goes down.

Anyway, glad to be back! hope everyone's doing well! Scoot and I will be back in portland in a couple weeks, and then you'll never be able to get rid of us! haha!
