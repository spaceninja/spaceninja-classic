One down, two to go!

Annie and I had a lot of fun this weekend. Annie took off Wednesday night to come up a little early for last minute dress stuff. I came up Thursday morning, and got picked up by Dave, who took me to pick up my tux. It fit perfectly, except the shoes, so I had to come back the next day to pick them up.

Then we went to the rehearsal, where we found out that groomsmen basically just stand around a lot. The rehearsal dinner was at C.I. Shenanagins (sp?), and was _excellent_. I had ordered the chicken, which I imagined would be some kind of broiled skinless chicken breast, but it turned out to be this awesome breaded chicken parmesan with potatos.

The next day we ran a lot of errands, and then finally retired to Dave's apartment around 3pm after kidnapping his parent's big TV, which we hooked up to my X-box and spend a fun evening playing dead or alive 3, and watching _Kung Pow!_

Everyone crashed on the couches and floor, and we were woken up at 6:30am by a really loud crack of thunder. It had quit raining by the time we left to play golf. We showed up to the golf course, and they immediately switched into "elitist jerk" mode, and gave us all kinds of hassles, including one guy in a golf cart who followed us around for the first six holes we played staring at us and demanding that we hurry up. He really stressed everyone out, but he finally left us alone for the last three holes, and we managed to have a little fun before discovering that we were running way late.

We headed back to Dave's apartment, where we all threw our tuxes on as quickly as possible, and 20 minutes later, the four of us stepped out into the parking lot to leave and realized that we all looked **really nice**. Being a carful of men in tuxedos we got a mixture of confused looks from men, and approving (sometimes flirting) looks from women.

Photos took forever, and it was hot, and there was goose poop all over the park we were in, and about halfway through we realized that we hadn't eaten anything since the fried chicken we had the night before, and some liquor we snuck onto the golf course. Around about 5pm, someone made a run to subway, and everyone had about a quarter of a footlong sub, which was possibly the best tasting sub I've ever had.

By the time the wedding started, the park was full of curious onlookers, including a group of heckling women on a park bench and a russian guy with his girlfriend (both obviously drunk), with his shirt unbuttoned to show off his furry chest, and about 30 other people just standing in the rose garden staring at the ceremony.

The sun had set far enough that most of the seats were in the shade, but no such luck up front. It was **hot** up there. At the end, when the minister presented Dave and Rose to the crowd, Rose had tears running down her cheeks, and Dave's face was dripping sweat. It looked like a cartoon of someone who was sweating a lot, it was just pouring off his face.

Then we went to the reception, where I changed into my sneakers because my feet were killing me (but I kept the tuxedo on, because it's kinda fun to wear). There was amazing food, and lots of drinking, and by the end of the evening, Dave's entire family was on the dance floor.

Zach and Noah and I snuck off to "decorate" the getaway car, but didn't have much luck. Zach had a bunch of condoms to put on the car, and we bought several cans of whipped cream and some bars of soap to write on the window with.

But there aren't very many places to put condoms on a car, so there was pretty much just the one over the antenna. The soap didn't actually leave white marks on the window, just a kind of soapy smear that you could only read up close. The whipped cream looked **great** for about two minutes, and then melted. By the end we hadn't so much decorated the car as just made it really dirty.
