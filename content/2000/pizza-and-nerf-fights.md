There are certain things that you just come to expect from a computer technician job.

- You will work in a dungeon. The office will either actually be underground, or the windows will be covered to prevent glare.

- Your coworkers will be social in spurts. Sometimes an hour or two will go by where three people sitting next to each other will say nothing at all. Twenty minutes later, you're throwing foam rubber balls at each other.

- There will be some sort of foam rubber projectiles available to hurl at your coworkers. Nerf stuff seems to be the most popular among larger companies, but smaller teams will make do with "stress" balls with computer company names emblazoned upon them, or in the case of gateway computers, small foam rubber cows.

- The entire team will frequent only one restaurant. There are other places to eat, but invariably if more than two of the crew are going out to eat, they will head to the standard place, which will frequently be a pizza place.

- There will be a large pile of empty soda pop cans/bottles in one corner of the room.

I could go on for a long time. I work on a tech team right now, and I know these standards well.

Today for the first time, I realized that I might not be working in dungeons all my life. If I get into graphic design as a career, the expectations are different! Graphic Designers tend to have windows!

Windows! Just imagine the possibilities! Fresh air, a view...

My prediction: I will end up at a great graphic design firm doing web design. The firm will inhabit an incredible office on the seventh floor of some building with a view of the waterfront. I will be the guy who inhabits the office with cardboard/tin foil covering the windows. People will come to me for computer problems because I have more computer knowledge than most designers, but they'll joke about my eccentric habits, such a staring silently at my computer for 2 hours and then suddenly pelting someone with a foam rubber ball. People will openly wonder why there is a pile of empty pop bottles in my office, or for that matter, why I have a large supply of foam rubber balls.
