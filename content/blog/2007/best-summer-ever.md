I love it when the robots who build Google News accidentally do something hilarious. I've previously mentioned the [Senate passing the Battle Royale act](/blog/2007/senate-passes-battle-royale-act/), and I think this is just as funny. Nestled in among other headlines about the Vanessa Hudgens nude photos was "Disney Channel claims 'best summer ever.'"
