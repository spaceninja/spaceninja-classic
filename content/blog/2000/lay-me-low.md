Hmm, upon reviewing Scott's earlier entry ("I am saddened to announce that my cohost here at KMorg, Miles, is deceased... Since he was a philosopher, there will be no funeral services in favor of everyone spending a few minutes contemplating the nature of life and death."), I find I have a problem with this.

MOMENT OF CONTEMPLATION, HELL!

When I kick off this Earth, [THIS](http://www.nick-cave.com/songbook/lay_me_low.htm) is how it's going to be. The poetry of violence, met with the utmost violence of Creation! The stars shall drop from their orbits, crushing the walls of Church and State alike! My friends shall be enobled, my enemies smitten with a plague of green boils, The flat shall be made crooked, the narrow tall, **the trees shall weep with the blood of the Serpent!!! AIEEE** the dark be made light, the light ~~~

`NO CARRIER_`
