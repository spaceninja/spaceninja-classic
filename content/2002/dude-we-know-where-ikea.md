dude, we know where Ikea is, we've been. but a trip home costs money...as you all know who've had to spot us before. :) thanks btw, we really appreciate it, and next week is paayday! whoohoo!  
  
p.s. My cousin's wife had a baby a couple hours ago, and his brother's wife is due next week...and I have 5 friends who are engaged right now, plus another cousin who's engaged with a pregnant fiancee....  
  
I feel so old...I konw everyone thinks I nag Scott all the time about getting married, but truthfully, I just need a party. I know he's not going anywhere, and we're definately not ready for kids yet.  
blah blah blah....
