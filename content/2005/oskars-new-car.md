[![Oskar's New Car](/images/IMG_2568.JPG)](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/oskar/IMG_2568.JPG "Oskar's New Car")

Here's Oskar playing in his new push-along car in the backyard as Dave and I built a firepit. He was thrilled, and stayed in it, squealing in joy for hours. He even ate dinner in it. I think it's safe to say that the car is a hit.
