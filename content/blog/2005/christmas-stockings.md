[![Christmas Stockings](/images/blog-photos/stockings.jpg)](/images/blog-photos/stockings.jpg)

Mrs. Stockman surprised us today with two new Christmas stocking she had made for us. Annie's is bright red with a fairy holding a strawberry, and mine has Pirate Santa. Pirate Santa is like normal Santa, only he's got a pegleg, a pirate flag, and a bad attitude. Look at him scowl! (But deep inside, he's a nice old guy). Pirate Santa is the best.
