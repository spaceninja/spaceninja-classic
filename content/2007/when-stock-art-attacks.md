[![Information Week Cover Illustration](/images/2034706205_ac86977d3f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2034706205/)

This magazine cover is a perfect example of why you should always have someone else review any art decisions you make. There are several things in this illustration that don't make any sense...

1. The kid on the left, I assume, is supposed to represent current, cutting-edge technology -- hence, the Web 2.0 shirt -- so why is he playing Pong?
2. I guess that old is represented by wearing a tie, being unshaven, and working, while youth is represented by spiking your hair, getting a facial piercing, wearing flannel shirts (seriously? What is this, the nineties?), dirty Converse and t-shirts while playing video games on your cell phone, listening to your ipod, and wearing sunglasses inside your cave-like office.
3. Which side is this article taking? The photo and intro paragraph imply that the old IT guys need to adapt to modern technologies, and are unhappy about it. But the "Grow Up!" headline implies that the young new-tech guys need to get serious. The only conclusion this illustration gives me is that no one is happy.
4. Whose glasses are those on the desk?
5. How many monitors does this guy need? Seriously, I count either four or five, wrapping around this guy like some Hollywood movie's idea of a professional workstation. Clearly, more monitors = more professional.
