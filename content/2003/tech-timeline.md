Well, my new copy of Wired showed up today, and it contained a "tech timeline" showing the developments that have taken place over the last 10 years. That turned out to be an ad, so I went ahead and modified it slightly to post here.  
  
I was surprised by how blazingly fast the internet has risen to its currently prominent position in just 10 years. Not only that, but by how long Steve and I have been participating in it. He and I both had websites in 1995, and we started devoting serious energy to it by the time we graduated from high school.  
  
I mean, doesn't that seem weird? Within two years of this technology really coming to power, Steve and I were already actively involved in it. That seems really odd to me. Anyways, enough babbling from me. Here's the timeline.
