soo...it's body part movie night at our house... without planning it, I picked up HAIR & a documentary called BREASTS. the movie store lady was joking with us about having a body parts movie night, with those and things like "My left foot", "The man with two brains", & "body parts" to start off the whole thing. Anyone got any others?

heehee!
