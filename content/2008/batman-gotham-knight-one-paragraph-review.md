How about a one-word review? Disappointing. The summary says "Batman takes on Deadshot, Killer Croc and other deadly foes in six anime-inspired short films." The key words there are anime-_inspired_. This movie desperately wanted to be The Animatrix, but it failed because they got American writers and animators. The six shorts all have different styles, but none of them are interesting, because they're all direct imitations of the art styles from the Animatrix. There's some potential here, especially the story about Bruce training to resist pain in India, but ultimately the delivery flops.
