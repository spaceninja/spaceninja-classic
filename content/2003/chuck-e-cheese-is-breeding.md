Chuck E. Cheese is breeding a nation of loyal sports bar goers.  
  
Oh. My. God.  
  
There are no words to describe the horror that has become Chuck E. Cheese. There were actually video screens blaring out kid (and advertising) friendly versions of pop songs. the Bckstreet boys' "Larger than Life" became a song about recycling ...paper...or plastic...ugh.  
  
The worst though was "Living La Vida Loca" became "Drinking a Coca-Cola". Dance routines and everything. But I was drinking a Pepsi! WTF?!  
  
The full force of advertising towards kids is amazing when it's staring you in the face.  
  
It was almost exactly like being in a sports bar, only brighter. Awful music, too loud T.V. unsteady people who love to bump into you. The feeling that there shouldn't be babies there even though there are....  
  
I was seething...  
  
and then we hit the cereal isle in Fred Meyer....
