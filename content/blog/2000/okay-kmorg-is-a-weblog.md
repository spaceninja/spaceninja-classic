Okay. KMorg is a [weblog](http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Search_Results_Exact/1,282033,,00.html?query=weblog). I resisted this definition at first, because I misunderstood the definition of a weblog. According to [whatis.com](http://www.whatis.com/), a weblog "...is a Web site of personal or non-commercial origin that uses a dated log format and that is updated on a daily or very frequent basis with new information about a particular subject or range of subjects. The information can be written by the site owner, gleaned from other Web sites or other sources, or contributed by users." A weblog is kinda the same thing as a [blog](http://www.whatis.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214616,00.html).

This clearly defines what this site is. So why the confusion? I was thinking that weblog was a frequently update collection of links, as opposed to just a site that is update frequently.
