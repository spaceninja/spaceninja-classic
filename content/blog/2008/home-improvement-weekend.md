Due to a decent tax refund, we've finally decided to get around to all the home improvement and decorating we've been meaning to do since moving into this house two years ago. This past weekend, I did the following:

- Go to Ikea, purchase things
- Assemble the file cabinet that came in like eight boxes
- Assemble the new bookcase
- Move Zoe's bookcase to the living room
- Rearrange all the bookcases in the living room
- Unclog the bathroom sink
- Hang coat hooks in Zoe's room
- Sort through comic boxes before we donate the comics to a shelter

Add to this list the curtains and shelves we purchased and hung up last weekend, and I'm about sick of home improvement projects. Good thing this next week will bring Grand Theft Auto 4 for game night and Iron Man for the twins' birthday over the weekend!
