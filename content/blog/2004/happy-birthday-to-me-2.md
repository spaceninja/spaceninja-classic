Well, it's that time of year again. The time when families gather around the radio set, children listen closely to their teachers, and fathers keep an extra ear open for the gossip in the old barbershop.

That's right. Old Man Birthday is coming to town, and today he's working twice as hard, 'cuz it's my birthday _and_ Sean's.

The bane of my existence, or so it feels come April. Right about the point where I start to think "Hey, it's my birthday in a few weeks! Maybe I'll plan a big party this year and actually invite people and get decorations! Maybe a costume party! Yeah, that'd be great!"

Then I remember: "Oh yeah . . . it's Sean's birthday, too. I better figure out something cool to get him."

And all the energy I've saved up over the year to build up into a really cool birthday celebration, all of it slips out the back door with it's little tail wagging between it's legs, off to invigorate somebody else's birthday plans, somebody without the specter of Sean haunting every party they've ever thrown for themselves, making them feel bad for having fun without him.

Someone like my cousin Danny. By an odd coincidence, his birthday's today, too. And he doesn't have some stupid twin brother to muck it up.

Lucky bastard.

**Happy 23rd Birthday, Sean!!!**
