[![Moon Shots!](/images/moon-shot-th.jpg)](http://leilani.spaceninja.com/kmorg/moon-shot-desktop.jpg)

Here is the best shot I got from the lunar eclipse last night. It's not a terribly great shot of the eclipse itself (the moon was 3/4 out of the earth's shadow at this point, with a nice crescent effect) but it was a pretty decent shot by itself. I don't know why it had the corona, but all the shots I took in that batch did.

Enjoy!
