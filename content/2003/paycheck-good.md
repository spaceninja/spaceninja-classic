I got paid today, and was releived to find the amount higher than I expected, which means that I could pay off the people I owe money to, as well as have a little spending money.

I bought myself a couple movies (_Matrix Reloaded_, _Office Space_, and pre-ordered _The Two Towers_), got a wi-fi hub so that I can use my laptop anywhere in the house without having to drag a cable behind me, and I ordered Satellite TV!

The free setup deal that Dish Network has up on their website was just too much to pass up, especially when I balanced it out and found out that it costs less per month than the same cable plan, and it comes with a digital recorder, which is like the off-brand version of TiVO, so I can record stuff digitally, and pause live TV and goofy stuff like that.

Oh, and my boss just told me that we'll be going to the [Northwest Event Show](http://bravoseattle.com/event_show/home.htm), which is a convention that one of our clients is running, and we might be doing the onsite registration system as well as the web registration.

Finally, the really nice piece of news is that my portion of the image gallery program that Steve and I are writing is nearly done. I should be able to hand the templates off to Steve this weekend, so he can code them up. With a little luck, we'll have a functional version of Gallery 5000 by the end of the month, which is great, since we have several people who are already interested in running it (including ourselves). I'm really proud of the work I've done on this. It's the first time we've approached programming like this, where we came up with details plans for what the program should do before we ever write a single line of code, and as a result, I don't feel like any of the functionality has been compromised. It's all powerful, flexible, and good-looking!

PS - The last few honeymoon posts will be coming soon.
