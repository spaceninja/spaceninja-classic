[![Get Firefox](/images/getfirefox.png "Get Firefox")](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)

Mozilla released new versions of their stand-alone browser and email client today. Firebird has been renamed [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) and is at version 0.8, and [Thunderbird](http://mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) has reached version 0.5.

The most striking change is the default theme for Firefox under OS X has been changed to the "[pinstripe](http://kmgerich.com/pinstripe/screenshots/browser/tabbrowsing.png)" theme, which better matches the standard Aqua design (though, mysteriously, the official screenshots posted by the designer don't feature the pinstripes...), and there's [news that Thunderbird will probably be following](http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2004/february/brandingmozilla) in that trail.

Firefox also got a brand new icon, which looks 100% better than the old icon. These applications are getting more respectable with each passing version, and hopefully it won't be long before they start taking a greater market share.
