Annie and I are starting to feel the crunch. 2 months to go, still plenty of wedding stuff to do. Plus we've been trying to clean the house, since we're going to have company for the rest of the week. Then there's little details like looking into getting car insurance, and seeing if we have enough money to get married AND have a honeymoon. (It looks good at the moment, because we're doing a low-budget honeymoon, just driving down to the redwoods and exploring the Oregon coast).  
  
I got a laptop and a touch-screen monitor yesterday. The touch-screen monitor is to go along with the barcode/creditcard reader I got last month, which are both for testing our software for the convention at work. The laptop is a long-term-loan from work so I'll have a computer for when we go on trips like this. It's a PII 300-something Mhz ThinkPad, with 64 MB of RAM. Suprisingly, it's running XP and doing a decent job of it. Normal usage is good speed, but heavy processing can be sluggish. Still, new toy.  
  
I've had to switch from doing laundry on the weekends to doing it on weekdays because my downstairs neighbors have recently decided that they're more important than me, so it's okay for them to pull my laundry out of the drier before it's done, so they can throw theirs in. I find this incredibly infuriating, but lucky for me, I work from home, so I can just adjust my schedule to do it when they're not here.  
  
Last night I went over to KT's to watch the BBC's terrible adaptation of the [Gormengast](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/gormenghast/home.html) novels. It wasn't that bad until they tried to do anything dramatic. It featured the least-compelling sword fight I've ever seen... Actually, to their credit, the show _looks_ amazing. It's just that the plot is quite a bit watered down from the books.  
  
Well, my ever-expanding to-do list is beckoning me. Time to end this post.
