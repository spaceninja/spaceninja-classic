I feel like a character in a video game who just picked up a health pack.  
  
Last week was stressful. This weekend, I just had fun. My stress levels are down, and I'm happy again. I'm even looking forward to starting work on an art project I have, and finishing up some web stuff I've been doing in my spare time.  
  
Annie was with her mom this weekend, so instead of kicking the boys out by 2 or 3 AM like I normally do on Saturday, we stayed up all night. We played lots and lots of Worms2, and even got Steve in on the action. After Steve left, we sat down and played some multiplayer Halo deathmatch, which was a blast. There's about 20 various styles of deathmatch, including my favorite, rocket tag (it's not really tag, I just call it that because you get nothing but rockets). Then we played Jet Set Radio until we met Steve at House of Louie for Dim Sum at noon.
