Well, no thanks to the Taiwanese tech support guys, I managed to get my video card working. I was about to pull it out and put my old card back in so that my computer could be somewhat normal for awhile, and then I decided to put it back in and give it one more shot. Appearently, I didn't have the card seated right, because this time it worked right off the bat. Turns out AGP cards have this odd little snap that you have to press in to insert the card, which I had forgotten about. I'm not sure why it's there. It's not like cards fall out of their slots all the time normally...

Anyways, the good news is that my new video card is functional, and it plays all my games very very well. Halo PC looks incredible, rivalling the way it looks on the XBox, and Doom now runs at 800x600 in high resolution mode, instead of 640x480 in low resolution mode. I could actually run it at 1024x768, but I suffer a slight framerate hit. It's probably tolerable, but it runs just a bit smoother at 800x600, and I couldn't see any difference in the graphics, so I'm leaving it at 800 and getting dynamite results.

It'll be exiciting to see what kind of results I can get with Half Life 2 next month.
