proof that world of warcraft is 'neat'. scott's minotaur character is on a quest to save christmas for the children of ogre-mar by baking cookies.

there's a big tree in the middle of town wrapped in chains and broken ornaments, with a glowing skull at the tip. christmas lights are everywhere, and little old goblins in santa outfits are selling spices, candy canes, and holiday wrapping paper.
