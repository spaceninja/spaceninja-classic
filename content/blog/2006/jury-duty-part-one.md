7:45: There's a line to get inside, due to the airport-style security checkpoint. People are actually cutting in line - are you really in that big a hurry for jury duty?

8:07: A judge is giving a history lecture on the importance of jury duty and the judicial system. I feel like I'm back in college.

9:48: Absolutely nothing happening. I'm catching up on internet stuff.

9:50: Spoke too soon, they just called my name.

12:50: Actually got assigned to a trial - I'm on lunch right now.

3:17: Home now. The trial was a bit diappointing, as it was about something really minor, and the guy got a not guilty due to a minor flaw in the evidence. Still, it's nice to know that I've "done my civic duty" and that I won't have to do so again for 2 years.
