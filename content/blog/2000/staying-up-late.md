I've been staying up later and getting up later every night. It's nearly 5am now, and I'm sure I won't get up until noon at least. I'm not tired at all. In fact, I'm feeling rather productive, so I might not go to sleep for awhile yet. Annie finds it terribly disturbing that I'm staying up so late, but it's funny that she feels that way, since she's the queen of sleeping in and staying up late. Admittedly, she usually crashes before 5am, but then so do I, normally. But as my sleep schedule shifts, I find that there are some advantages to nocturnal living. Everyone's asleep, so no one's making a ton of noise in our apartment complex. It's dark outside, so there's no glare on my monitor. Still, I'd gladly trade in this new sleep schedule for a regular job to pay the bills with. I'm applying at the deli down the street tomorrow. Keep your fingers crossed!
