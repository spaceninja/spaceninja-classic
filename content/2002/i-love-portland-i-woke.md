I love Portland. I woke up to a dismal gray overcast day. It was raining off and on, and I wasn't paying much attention until about 15 minutes ago there was the loudest roll of thunder I've ever heard. I looked out the window and it was pouring down hail. It hailed for several minutes, until it looked like it had been snowing, then all of a sudden it stopped hailing, and then a minute later it stopped raining too. Now it is bright and sunny, but looking to the west, I can see more dark clouds rolling in, and the light level is already dimming.
