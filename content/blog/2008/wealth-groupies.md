> Like "Joe the Plumber" — who is not a licensed plumber, whose first name isn't Joe, whose boss's business makes $100K, not $250K and isn't for sale, and who couldn't afford it if it were for sale based on his own income of $40K and his outstanding tax lien — a certain sad proportion of white blue-collar men I know are wealth groupies.

> Like Joe, they imagine they'll make big money some day. They imagine themselves rich some day. And so they doggedly vote as if they were rich already, voting over and over again against their own self-interest, because they don't want to identify with their own economic class — not in their hearts, and not in the voting booth, either.
