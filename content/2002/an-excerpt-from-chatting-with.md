An excerpt from chatting with my boss today. My thoughts are in italics.  
  
<M> talk to me scott  
_Hmm... What does he want to talk about?_  
<scott> what about?  
<M> anything..  
<M> anna wants to hear the wizard talk  
_Anna? Wizard? Is he making some kind of Wizard of Oz reference? Well, Whatever..._  
<scott> Well, you see Mogenns, when a man loves a woman very much....  
<M> she is 6  
_FUCK! Anna his DAUGHTER! And I just made a sexual joke! SHIT SHIT SHIT make a joke... try to play it off... maybe he's not mad..._  
<scott> whoops did I just make a bad joke in front of a child?  
<scott> \*sigh\* this is why they don't let me out in public.  
  

He laughed at that, but he also left the chat room quickly. I'm not fired or anything, but god only know what my boss thinks of me now. I'm an idiot.
