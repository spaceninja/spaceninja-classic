I've split this site into two, a personal one and a professional one. Spaceninja.com will remain my professional blog, with an emphasis on front-end web production. I've set up a new blog on [ScottVandehey.com](http://scottvandehey.com/) that I will be using for more personal posts about Zoe and non-web-development topics. Thanks for your patience.
