Oh my God, I just almost hit a cat after taking Zach home...I've never come that close before...even Scott's shaken, I forgot how much near trauma can make you tense up...It's definately a pain killer night...God, how awful would it have been to hit someone's cat? I'm also really lucky that it's late at night, and the one car that was behind me was far enough awayb that they didn't hit me when I slammed on my brakes.fuucck.
