<BIG>Y5 Announces New Line-Up</BIG>
<br><SMALL>By Shawn McCallister, freelance music consultant</SMALL>

<p>Fresh on the heels of his court victory to reclaim the band name Yellow Number Five from his former bandmates, Dr. Colossus has announced a brand new line-up for the group.

<p>J&ouml;rg Besson and Franka Kurtz, famous in Norway for their album of techno remixes of ABBA songs have been drafted to the infamous group. In a press release, Colossus announced his intention to shape the group into the world's foremost remixing act, a type of group that takes other band's songs and reworks them as they see fit.

<p>"J&ouml;rg and Franka are the talent this group was lacking before my return," announced Colossus. "With me at the helm, this group can't help but catapult to spectacular new hights of wealth and excess."

<p>Yellow Number Five is currently working on new material, and plans to have a demo CD out to radio stations and promoters by early summer, with plans for a full-length album by year's end.

<p>When asked for comments, former band members just referred us to their agents, who all said that while the musicians were unhappy with the situation, they were planning on continuing with their solo acts, and were considering a reunion group tour in Las Vegas this summer.
