These are my new toys. I just ordered them last night, and they should be here in a week or so. The JVC receiver is the stereo I've had my eyes on for awhile now. It not only does all the regular audio stuff you expect a receiver to do, it's also full 6.1 surround-sound. And as if that wasn't cool enough, it's also got video inputs so you can use it as a video switcher.

The other item I'm very excited about is the digital camera. I've been wanting to get one for some time now, and the finances and motivation (in the form of lots of family members having babies) have finally fallen into place to allow it. I did a lot of research before I picked the Canon A80, and I'm really excited to get my hands on it. It gets high marks across the board at the review sites. It can function with fully automatic settings for point-and-shoot stuff, but it also has complete manual settings to allow me to get back into photography, which I haven't been able to pursue seriously for several years.
