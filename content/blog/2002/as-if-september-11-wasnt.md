As if September 11 wasn't a hard enough date to deal with, as I'm poking through my spam filtered email today, I noticed no less than three emails offering to sell me 9/11 commerative merchandise with appealing subjects like "Show your patriotism" or "Get a custom 9/11 flag!" They carefully point out "A percentage of the profits will be donated to a 9/11 fund!" ...As if that makes profiteering on a tragedy acceptable. It sickens me that some people see this as an opportunity to make money.
