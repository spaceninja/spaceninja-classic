Tonight, for the first time in about three years, Lisa Loeb played in Portland. KT and I have often joked that we're probably the only two Lisa Loeb fans in Portland, as evidenced by the fact that she never plays here. We figured we'd be proven wrong tonight, since she wasn't opening for anyone, but once we got there, we found out she hadn't brought her whole band, just one extra guy to play backup guitar. It was still a fun concert though, and the third song she played was probably the highlight of the night.

> Okay, this next song is from our upcoming album... _(Lisa begins playing a slow song... about 30 seconds into it, she stops playing abruptly)_ ...Maybe this isn't the best time to play this song. It sounds like they're washing the dishes. _(in the background, you can hear someone spraying off the dishes from the grill)_ ...Man, what are they washing back there? It sounds like they're rinsing out a big tub... a big plastic tub. I guess we shouldn't play such a slow song now. _(begins strumming guitar again)_ ...something a little more upbeat... like... the Plastic Tub song! It goes like this... _(Lisa begins imitating the sound of the spray on the tub while playing guitar. Everyone laughs)_ Hmmm... what song could we play? _(woman in front row yells "PLAY THE TUB SONG!")_ ...The what? ...what? Tab song? ...tab? Oh! Oh! The TUB song! Man, I thought you were saying Tab. ...Y'all have got some thick accents. I'm from Texas, and I was like 'tab song? what tab song?'

After that, she improvise this totally funny song about how she wanted some wine, and she deserved it because the only bad thing she'd had today was a few donuts in Seattle.
