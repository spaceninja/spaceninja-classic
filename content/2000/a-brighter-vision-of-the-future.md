unlike miles and his paranoid neal stephenson-induced techno-prognostico-delusions, i have a much brighter vision of the future!

a future where you can have your auto-mobile any color you like, just as long as it's black! with a chicken in every pot, and a cardboard cutout of scott and me in every living room (with a tape deck blasting our witty conversations, volume kept at 11 by government mandate), people can finally rest that the capitalist scurvy has been stamped out with the vitamin C tablet of Fojar-powered fascism!

the psychotropic "chameleon clothes" will know that their computational powers are best put to use in the missions, spreading the word and the face of FOJAR in stunning red, yellow, and black, to all the savage peoples of europe who still maintain that they are "frenchmen" or "finns"- with time and education they _will_ understand that they are all brothers under us.

reality is changing every day, but it isn't technology that's changing it. it isn't good old-fashioned elbow grease, either. and it certainly isn't sci-fi speculation! the force for the new tomorrow is Fojar. Fojar is the future. Fojar is **your** future.
