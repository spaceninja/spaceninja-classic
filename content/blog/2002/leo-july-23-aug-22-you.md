EEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!
HeeHee! We're engaged!!! :)

**Scott's Followup:** I proposed to Annie today, figuring it was the best birthday present I could ever get her. God knows what I'll do next year... Anyways, we haven't decided when or anything like that yet, but I'm sure Annie will keep you all WELL informed. A better quality photo of the ring is forthcoming.
