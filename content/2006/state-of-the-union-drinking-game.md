President Bush will be giving the [State of the Union](http://www.c-span.org/executive/stateoftheunion.asp) on Tuesday, and you know what that means: It's time for our annual [State of the Union Drinking Game](http://www.drinkinggame.us/)! This year it includes classics such as taking a drink whenever the President receives a standing ovation from half of Congress, says "nukular", or references God. There are also additions for references to Scooter Libby, Arial Sharon, Jack Abramoff and the new Supreme Court justices (Shout “Oyez, oyez, oyez, this drink will come to order”, then drink).

Good thing I have the week off from work - I suspect I will have difficulty getting out of bed on Wednesday.
