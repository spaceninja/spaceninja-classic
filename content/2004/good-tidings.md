Annie and I had a great Christmas, though it was VERY busy. On Friday morning, we went to Annie's Grandma's house (on her dad's side) and had brunch. Then we went to her Grum and Grumpa's house (on her mom's side), where we had dinner and saw the whole family, including her cousin Jamey's new baby Jaden.

Saturday we did Christmas morning at her parents' house with Dave and Rose, Zach, and Sean before we piled in the car to drive to Portland, where we did Christmas morning with my parents. Leilani handed out all the presents and was generally adorable.

Sunday we drove down to Eugene to do Christmas with my grandparents and the rest of my family. Nearly everyone showed up, and the food was great. The best part was right before we left, though, when Pop-Pop pulled out a binder with all the mementos from when he was in the Navy during WWII.

He had all these tiny photos from Japan and Korea, a certificate he received for crossing the equator, and a bunch of memo-type letters that were given to the crew about the Japanese surrender, which he was there for. The one regarding crew conduct towards the Japanese people was really interesting, and basically told them not to be friendly or cruel. It reminded them that they were part of an occupying military force and that while the Japanese should not be mistreated, they should not be treated as forgiven just yet, either.

I also found out that I have Scottish heritage, which I didn't know. Grammy says that she's part of the Grant clan, and the Patricks (or Patterson/Patison) sept.

Today we're running over to $Boss' house to pick up a load of stuff he wants me to deliver in Seattle, and going to a movie at the Laurelhurst, and maybe meeting Miles' girlfriend if we can hook up with him in time.
