- **Papa John's:** Annie and I were told to contact the guy today to see if he was interested in hiring two more people. I went by today, and he told me to come back on Saturday. It feels like he's giving us the run-around, but he keeps saying that he will probably need two people, and we desperately need the job, so...
- **Meadowlark:** The woman who runs the bed and breakfast here is looking into getting a website for her shop. I'm meeting with her tonight to discuss options. Looks promising, even if it's not long-term.
- **Gordon:** Gordon is the guy that Jester referred me to. He's been kinda hard to get ahold of, but he's the one who seems most into me and my work. He said he showed my stuff to his crew, and he's interested. The advantage is that he would let me telecommute, so I could work from home. The disadvantage is that he doesn't even have anything for me to try out with until early November. Still, the ability to do web design from home with someone who's excited about working with me? Very appealing.
- **CWU Webmaster:** I was nervous about this job because the woman said the position was closed (indicating they hired someone), the front page of the site was updated, and a few other bad signs. I found out today that the guy doing the updates is a TEMP! Excellent. My chances are still open. Keep your fingers crossed. I think I've got a good shot at this job, it pays well, and I'll know by the end of the month, basically.
