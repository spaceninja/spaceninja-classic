I quit posting to hatelife quite awhile ago, because I didn't really hate anything. Honestly, I hadn't hated anything since highschool, and there was only so much old angst I could post about.

But I'm back, baby!

Yeah, I know it's nothing original to be hating your job sometimes, but that's what's going on with me right now.

In essence, my boss acts like a three-year old. He has terrible communication skills (and he knows this), but all of our communication is done over ICQ.

Naturally, sometimes, I have no clue what he's asking. Usually he's good about my requests for clarification, and just responds. But sometimes, he throws a temper tantrum and just signs off ICQ and won't answer his phone, because:

He's mad at me for not understanding.

What the hell? First of all, it's not \*my\* fault that he doesn't make any sense. Secondly, he's the boss! He's not allowed to throw a temper tantrum, because when he does so, it holds up my work, because he won't answer my questions!

AAAGH

To make matters worse, I can't really say anything, because who knows how the boss will handle criticism from his subordinate, and I don't wanna get fired for this.

Nonetheless, I'm sick of this shit. I'm going to talk to him about it, and I'm going to do my best to make him understand what a terrible position it puts me in when he pulls this bullshit.
