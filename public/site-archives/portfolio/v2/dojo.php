<p>After graduating, I faced flagging motivation to work on design in my spare time. To combat this, I started a weekly art project called Dojo. The goal was simply to produce a new work every week. I set no limitations on myself other than the time limit, and managed to stick with it for a few months before higher priority projects forced me to abandon it. This is the fourth piece to come out of the project, hence Dojo 04.</p>
