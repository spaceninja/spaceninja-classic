While driving to a pedicure appointment this weekend, Annie got rear-ended again. She was stopped, and the guy just drove into her. She's fine, and (amazingly) it appears the only car damage was cosmetic. Of course, this has aggrivated her existing back conditions, so she's very stiff and is moving very slowly right now. The good news is that she's been through this before and knows how to handle it, so she's taking good care of herself, and is making appointments for chiro. and massage, which should be covered under the insurance. We'll post if anything more happens, but for now, things seem to be fine, aside from aggrivating some existing back problems.

Other than that, our weekend was pretty good. We bought two vacuum cleaners on Saturday (one upright for carpets, and one small canister for stairs and dusting and such). Then on Sunday, I got together with Dad to build a big table with some shelves on it that is sized just right to hold my comic book boxes, so that they'll finally have a home. Unfortunately, the table is too big to fit through the door into the laundry room like I planned, so instead it looks like it will be sort of like a bar in the basement.
