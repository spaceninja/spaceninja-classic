In my dream last night, I was walking down the hallway of the building I live in. It was a cross between a dormatory and a hotel. I could tell it wasn't a hotel, because a lot of other people lived there, too. It definitely looked and felt like a hotel, though. The hallways were set in sort of a zigzag so you wouldn't feel like you were walking along this huge long straight hallway. I had been walking for awhile, though, so I guess the hallway was pretty long. I was in a good mood as I walked, and was singing "Heart-break Hotel" to myself as I walked (which is odd, as I never really liked Elvis much). I realized someone was coming down the hallway, so I quit singing, but I was in too good a mood to stop altogether, so I kept whistling. A girl I'd never seen before (but kind of recognized) walked around the bend in the hallway, and we made eye contact for a brief second. She seemed amused that I was whistling. I kept walking, and right before I got to my room she came back from the other direction, and let herself into the room next to mine. I was kind of pleased, because she was cute, and had smiled at me (which was alright, because I was single in this dream). Right after shutting the door, I heard a noise in the hallway, and peeked through the peephole and saw the girl walk into the men's room across the hall from my room. I decided to follow her, and walked into the men's room and splashed some water on my face from the sink. In the mirror, I could see her standing by a large card table, around which about 8 guys were playing a card game I'd never seen before. The girl saw me, and smiled as she asked "Who whistles, anyways?"

And in case you're not interested in my dream, here's a link to Penn (of Penn and Teller) talking about his brush with [airport security](http://pennandteller.com/sincity/penniphile/federalvip.html).
