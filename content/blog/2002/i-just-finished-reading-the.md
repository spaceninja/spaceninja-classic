I just finished reading the Silmarillion, which is basically J.R.R. Tolkien's history of Middle Earth. It's harder to read than the Lord of the Rings. In fact, it reads a lot like a textbook. But now that I finished it, I know so much more about the background of the story. Basically, the quest of the ring is a tiny little footnote that Tolkien decided to expand upon from an epic history he had conceived. It's very impressive.

The reason I mention this, though, is that afterwards, I was looking up Lord of the Rings stuff online, and I stumbled across [The Encyclopedia of Arda](http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/), a fantastic cross-referenced encyclopedia of information about Lord of the Rings. While you're there, make sure you check out the debate on [whether or not Balrogs have wings](http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/b/balrogs.html) and [who Tom Bombadil is](http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/t/tombombadil.html).

Especially fun to read are their [notes for people who saw the movie](http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/movie.html), which point out differences between the film and the books, and little details in the movie that you may not have notices.
