I have a confession to make. The real reason I haven't been posting as much lately is because I've been working on this â€” converting my blog into the greatest Lisa Loeb fan site ever! Stay tuned over the coming weeks, as I will examine in great detail some of the following topics:

- Is Lisa the greatest pop singer of our (or any) generation? She just might be!
- Is Lisa as cute as a button? (hint: yes)
- Lisa's impact on foreign relations
- Which of Lisa's albums would I take with me on a desert island?

So stick with me as I work on this new design, because I gotta admit it, I'm a Lisa Loeb fan. I celebrate her _entire_ collection.
