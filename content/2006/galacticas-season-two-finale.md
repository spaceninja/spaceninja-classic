Sounds like I'm one of the only people who wasn't [disappointed](http://www.chrisjdavis.org/2006/03/11/what-is-up-with-battlestar-galactica/) [with](http://del.icio.us/fraying/bsg) Galactica's finale... What did you think?

**Followup:** Well, at least Michael over at [Binary Bonsai liked it](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/03/14/battlestar-season-2-sumup/), so I'm not the only web developer who did.
