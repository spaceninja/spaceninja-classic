Well, finals are almost over, and life is starting to become a little more managable. The big news is that I'm moving! I'm going to try to get the place today, and then Annie and I are moving in next Friday. This weekend I'm headed up to Ellensburg to help her move her stuff back to Tacoma so that she can pack and move it to Portland. :D I, on the other hand, only have to move about 12 blocks. She's going to rent a U-Haul to move all her stuff, and the day she has that here, I'm going to move all my stuff in it, too.

Other than that, Steve FINALLY got his DSL line in, so within a week, spaceninja.com should be up and active! There's still a few details to sort out before I can buy the domain name and switch servers, but it should all go pretty smoothly from here on out.

Jester's back in town! Well, sort of. He's got himself a kolij gradumakashun, and he's busy doing interviews at all sorts of big-name computer game companies like Mindspring and Nintendo. I'm insanely jealous.

This summer is going to be busy. Annie's trying to talk me into going to Vegas with her and her friends, KT's trying to talk me into going to Disneyland with her and Erica, I'm going to the beach at least twice, I'm moving, we're going to Lilith Fair, and I'm going to be really REALLY broke.

I'm kinda nervous about the move. I mean, I'm basically just dropping Annie into the middle of my social life. I'm sure she'll get along with everyone great, and she'll fit in really quick, but I guess I've got last-minute jitters that once she moves down here, her and KT will hate each other or something dumb like that. It'll be nice to get the move overwith so I can stop worrying about stuff.

I'm legal now. As of June 1st, I'm 21. I haven't done anything with this except to buy a friend beer one night. Too busy with finals. Maybe after I move I'll get some vodka.

I like the warmer weather because people start looking better and wearing less, but it does make it a little more frustrating to see loads of really attractive women, because, as Annie says, "I'm surrounded by people who aren't you!"

I better go now... I still have a lot of work to do in order to get the website shaped up for the move.
