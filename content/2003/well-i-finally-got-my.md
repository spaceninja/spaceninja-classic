well, i finally got my ibook, and it is nice! it comes with an AIM-based instant message client, among other things, which imported not only the most recent list of clients i'd had on trillian, but all manner of older people, too. so i got to take a trip down memory lane when i removed all the people who i no longer talk to, never really talked to, or who no longer talk to me. unfortunately, the latter makes up the lion's share of defunct screen names ;)  
  
still, if i don't have anyone's AIM name, and you're not in one of the aforementioned three groups, drop me a line! (i'm not listing my name here b/c there are many prying eyes out there.)
