I started restoring sites yesterday.

[Spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.local/)/[.net](http://www.spaceninja.net/) is restored, though I will probably redesign it as I don't think I'm offering web design services anymore. It'll probably become more of a portfolio site for me.

[Strawberrystudios.org](http://www.strawberrystudios.org/) is back up, and I will probably be reworking it a bit to give annie a photo gallery program to post photos to.

[Rusted](http://rusted.killingmachines.org/) is back, obviously.

[KMorg](http://www.killingmachines.org/) is its own story. I'm in the middle of writing a new PHP script to display journals, since F5K doesn't work on my new hosting.

[Oscorp.net](http://www.oscorp.net/) and [studiofojar.com](http://www.studiofojar.com/) are both online, but I don't have a website for either one (studio fojar doesn't existing anymore, but I still have the domain).

Finally, [newsbeat.org](http://www.newsbeat.org/) is online, and I'll be meeting with Jill on Saturday to discuss what form the website will take.

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Rusted became the Space Ninja Blog - but you already knew that, since you're here. :)
