**LOOOOOOOOK**

[http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~chaz/chat/](http://www.dslnorthwest.net/~chaz/chat/)

Coded from scratch, yo! Four days of intense learning and effort have culminated into this... (I can only hope it helps me get a good job some day.) Fortunately, I think the bulk of it is in place. In fact, the code is so modular that you can drop new rooms and actors into the appropriate folders, and the program will immediately recognize them and work with them. Slick, no?

Soon there will be a feature allowing users to choose actors in \_any\_ directory on the web, so they won't be limited to the ones that come with the program. Hot cha cha. (Actually I know good and well what that entails: A homogenous mass of anime characters, mowing over everything like carnivorous, vampiric sheep turned loose on a lawn of raw, squirming beef, destroying everything in their path. Ugh. Oh well.)

The only hurdles left really are cosmetic ones. Some are simple, like putting a cap on how big actor pictures can be, and reading in the image HEIGHT and WIDTH tags before attempting to render each page. Some are more difficult, like the prospect of having the characters face left and right consistently. Uuuhh that one's actually a logical nightmare.

Anyway, hurry and give it a look before someone discovers some bug that corrupts lots of critical files (which has already happened a couple times!!! AAH bugs) ... AND if you're interested in drawing your own actor, hint hint! (notice there's only one right now, thanks Miles!), check this directory:

Notice the \_moods.txt file contains the regex's that control the actor's moods, meaning that you don't have to adhere to the moods given for the Cyan Cube â€” you can invent and use any moods you want.
