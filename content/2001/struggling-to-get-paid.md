the past 72 hours have been stranger than i could ever have imagined.

being strung along for pay by my company (they're now a month late) was irritating and stressful.. until i talked with my coworker at length, and things came to new light. basically, no matter how fucked you think you might be by not getting paid, some people elsewhere could be looking at jail time as a result of not getting paid.. and that's a much scarier prospect. i won't say more than that, but i basically do not worry for my own situation anymore.. \_i\_ will still be just fine.....

when i decided that i couldn't wait to be paid any longer, that it wouldn't happen any time soon, when i actually committed to finding an alternative to \_my job\_ for being paid and have started to make other arrangements, now the news is that they've actually struck a deal and are receiving actual honest-to-god money. yoink. if they do get their money, then i'm set, and if they don't, then i won't be as comfortable, but things'll still go all right.

it's like the universe was waiting for me to "get" that- that i'd need to be able to get myself out of this mess without asking for (and receiving- lord knows i've hoped) a miracle. and who knows, maybe they'll never actually be able to pay me the $10k they owe me.. but if they do now, bonus.

jessica was very nice last night, too, which caught me totally off guard. it's uncharacteristic for her to be nice when she doesn't stand to benefit directly.. but it was very pleasant, and after the events of the previous few days it sort of tied things up in a way i'm happy with.

> they laughed at me, wanting you.. said it would be "hello, good-bye" but ooh, you came through, now they're eating humble pie.. they all said we'd never get together; darling, let's take a bow.. for ho, ho, ho- who's got the last laugh now!
