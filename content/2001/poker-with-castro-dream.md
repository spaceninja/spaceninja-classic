Last night I had a dream that I was playing poker with Castro. We were getting along well, like we were old buddies. It was a big deal that he was there, because the government wanted him for some reason. Then we tried to negotiate a treaty, because he wouldn't talk to anyone but us, but it failed when one of my friends pointed out that Castro smelled really bad.

And speaking of Castro, have you heard about the depraved dictator's cruel plot?
