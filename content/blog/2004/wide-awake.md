I overslept a bit today, so I'm having trouble falling asleep. Usually, I just read until I'm tired, but I read all the way to the end of my book, and I'm still awake, so I figured I might as well post.

Annie and I went to Lynn and Jeremy's tonight with Dave and Rose. L&J cooked up a fantastic meal (steak and rice and garlic bread), and we watched a bit of the extras on the _Return of the King_ DVD, which got here today. I played with Oskar after dinner, laid him down on the ground and knelt over him making faces and blowing in his face to make him laugh. That makes three times now that I've made him laugh, and it totally makes up for all the other times that he's screamed when I hold him.

I told everyone that I feel like a failure when I can't make Oskar stop crying, and that I knew it was silly, but it's a gut reaction and I totally feel that way when I have to hand him off to Rose or Dave. They all laughed and said to get used to that feeling.

I was bad today and played WoW all day, and didn't do anything on my to-do list, so tomorrow I have to do two things to catch up.

The box for my mac still hasn't shown up, and neither has our latest batch of netflix. I think the mail is running slow because of the holidays. On the other hand, the LoTR DVD got here on-time, so who knows.

The book I just finished (re)reading was _Microserfs_, which I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't read it. It's funny, and it always makes me want to post to my blog more often, but it also makes me feel like I'm not doing enough to follow my dreams, so I find myself refocussing my efforts on web design after reading it. This is not a bad thing.
