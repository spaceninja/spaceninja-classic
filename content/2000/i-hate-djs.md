I hate DJs. I really really hate DJs. There's only one that's even remotely worth listening to. All the others are completely suck-ass. All I want is to listen to my radio station in peace, but no, this lame idiot is babbling and ranting and NOT SAYING ANYTHING WORTHWHILE. If you have nothing to say then shut up and play some music! No one is listening to hear you talk!

I think I'll be a DJ.
