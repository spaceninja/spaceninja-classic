<br><b>Scott Vandehey - The Urban Legend</b>
<br><i>by Pat Todd</i>

<p>Though I don't know him well, I feel familiar with him.  Meeting just a few
times, it was easy to see that he'd fit right in as one of my friends.  We
like most of the same things, and I'm sure that given a week or so we could
turn each other onto the things that are different about each of us.

<p>Why Urban Legend you ask?  Well, as the story goes, my roomie Urn and I met
this strange young vixen (Annie if you must know) in the fall quarter of
98-99.  She then proceeded to dominate the conversation for some time.  We
fell in love with her.  She told us tales of this mystical boyfriend of
hers, and how we reminded her of him.  His name was Scott.  We didn't want
to share her (who does really?) so we deceided that the person known as
Scott didn't exist.  He was merely another aspect of Annie to shroud
herself into further mystery.

<p>Later in the year, it was proclaimed that a visit from the non-existant
Scott was to occur.  We were ready for a two-bit actor to play the part,
but were much surprised to learn the truth.  Scott Vandehey existed, and
was pretty cool really.  We immediatly changed our window sign (a movie
sign with changeable text), to "He Exists!"  Most everybody figured that
we'd discovered Jesus.  Pretty funny really when all we done was meet
Scott.  Definitely Not Jesus.

<p>So now that there was truth behind the myth of Scott.  He exists and
continues to do so (although I've heard of some attempts on his
life...).  He was the significant other to her royal shortness, and really,
just a barrier to a strawberry desert.

<p>Still, for all the world I wouldn't seperate the two, as I aspire to
someday be an Urban Myth myself.
