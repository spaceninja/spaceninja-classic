The shift from Portland to Ellensburg is pretty radical. Portland's temperature ranges from 30 to 80, with both of the extremes being fairly rare. The average temperature is probably around 60. Ellensburg on the other hand is around 100 in the summer, and around 10 in the winter. It's rarely a moderate temperature, we tend to be either really hot or really cold.

I'm adapting, though. While I still don't like really hot summers, the cold doesn't bother me as much. I can bundle up, and snow remains a novel experience.

What I'm sick and tired of, however, is biking to work. This is horrible. The drivers here are inconsiderate at best and at worst, downright aggresive towards bikers. You can't bike on the sidewalk, due to short blocks and a lack of wheelchair ramps. Riding in the street is dangerous, because if you ride in the car's area, you get traction, but have to deal with cars buzzing by you at 50 miles an hour. If you ride in the bike/parking lane, the lane is not only not cleared of snow, it has the plowed off stuff from the main road, all laid down over a layer of ice and compressed snow from the last snowstorm, making the traction non-existant.

I have five days left before we close for the break and move close enough for me to walk to work. :(
