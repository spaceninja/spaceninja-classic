[![Scott and Annie's Third Anniversary](/images/241298677_9a5173f949.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/241298677/)

Three years ago, Annie and I gathered all our friends and family together for [the best party we could imagine](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/sets/72157594246507650/). We had good food, good music, fantastic weather, and a ceremony that only lasted ten minutes. I walked down the aisle with Steve to the Imperial March, while Annie floated down to Pachelbel's Canon. There were two different cakes, plus cupcakes. We were so excited that we completely forgot to dance together (which was just as well, since we hadn't prepared any music to dance to, or a place to dance in). We tried as hard as we could to throw out any aspect of the wedding that was boring or excessive, and keep only the parts that really made us happy. We joke about Annie going barefoot, and me in my sneakers for the formal photos, or the downtempo music instead of a DJ, but those were the things that really made it our wedding.

When I think of that day, I remember lots of people smiling and laughing, but frankly, everyone paled in comparison to Annie, who was the happiest I've ever seen her. She was floating on air the whole day, and I was thrilled that I was a part of that.

I love you, Annie, and I hope that I can still make you smile like that 50 years from now.

Three weeks ago, Annie and I looked at a TV monitor and watched our baby's heart beat. When Annie found out she was pregnant again in July, we were thrilled, but we decided to play it safe this time and not announce it until the first trimester was over - which just happened a few days ago, so the timing is great. What better way to celebrate our anniversary than by announcing that we're having a baby?

The funny thing about the ultrasound is that it's early enough right now that the baby has plenty of room, and when the nurse jostled it, it slid around, which made Annie laugh, which caused the baby to go sloshing all over the place. It's like a water park in there right now.

We got the ultrasound on August 17th, at about 11 weeks, which is still too early to see the gender. We were basically just checking that everything was going well in there. There's some debate still about whether or not to find out the gender, but if we do, we'll of course post it. If it's a boy, we're thinking of John Henry, and if it's a girl, we're thinking of Zoe Lynn.

You can see the relevant dates over on [the baby page](http://baby.spaceninja.com/), which will be growing over the coming weeks. The baby's due date is **St. Patrick's Day**, March 17, 2007 (celebrating our Irish heritage).
