\[repost from my [deviantART account](http://spaceninja.deviantart.com/ 'deviantART: spaceninja')\]

Ever since graduating college, I've found my motivation to do anything creative to be at an all-time low.

When I was in high school, I drew every day. I spent hours in school, drawing comics, sketching people in my classes, or just doodling on plain sheets of typing paper with a ball-point pen.

When I got to college, I drew a little less, but I was taking illustration courses, and still producing a large volume of art, and experimenting with new techniques like brush and ink.

Later in college, I became much more interested in photoshop and web design, and found that I spent less and less time drawing and more and more time creating digital art.

And now I find that where I used to spend hours reading about web design and trying new techniques and constantly experimenting in photoshop, nowadays I open photoshop once or twice a month, and I just can't find motivation to do web design after spending all day sitting in front of my computer at work.

The same thing is true of photography. I took basic photography in middle school, two years in high school, and even a quick course in college.

I went from carrying my camera with me everywhere to rarely taking photos because I couldn't afford film. Then I couldn't afford a digital camera of decent quality.

So due to a variety of factors such as money, time, and interest, I've found my motivation to produce artwork in any form to be at an all-time low.

I want to change this.

I spent a good chunk of money buying myself a nice digital camera partly in the hopes of combatting this by at least removing the barriers that stood in my way of photography. I bought myself a nice small camera bag, and I'm trying to get back in the habit of carrying my camera with me whenever I go out.

I'm also trying to set up a photoblog on my website so maybe I can get in the habit of posting a photo every week.

The sad reality is that if you don't use a skill on a regular basis it will atrophy and die. I look and the illustrations I did in high school, and the kinds of photos I used to take, and I have to admit that I was much better at that time than I am now, and it's because I used to do art and photography every day.

The only way I'm going to get any better is to just start doing it all the time again.

Hmm... I set aside a half-hour every day to exercise - maybe I need to do the same thing for art.
