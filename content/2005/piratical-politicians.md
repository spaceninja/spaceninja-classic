According to [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/), The term "filibuster" originates from the Dutch word for pirates!

> Dutch pirates were known as **kapers** or **vrijbuiters** ("plunderers"), the latter combining the words _vrij_ meaning free, _buit_ meaning loot, and the ending _\-er_ meaning agent. The word _vrijbuiter_ was corrupted into the English **freebooters** and French **flibustiers**. It came back into English as **filibusters**, who were not pirates, but adventurers involving themselves in Latin American revolutions and coups and then finally came to mean the disruptive parliamentary maneuver of talking without stopping. \-- Wikipedia article on [Pirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates)
