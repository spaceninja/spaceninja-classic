I went and checked out the aftermath of the fire that crisped an entire block of Portland today, near 12th and Salmon... It was after midnight, and the fire had abated, save for a few smoking hot spots which were being vigorously hosed down.

But aside from that, it was chilling/fascinating to stare at the wreckage of the building and take stock of all the damage the fire had caused. Windows were blown apart, rafters and girders hung about everywhere, a rolling metal door had melted and slumped. The walls were streaked and charred, and the streets flooded with smooth layers of water that flowed out of the building as the fireman did their thang.

The news said that the fire had combusted, and spread out to swallow the block in _two seconds_. I've read a little bit about that, and how fire crews in the wilderness are always wary of fires suddenly mushrooming and tearing down the mountainside, but when you see it happen to a man-made structure, on an urban scale, it's supremely haunting.

I stood there for a long time, thinking, "If I only had a camera."
