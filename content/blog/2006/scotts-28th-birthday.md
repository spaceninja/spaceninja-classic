Hooray! Today is my 28th birthday!

I was going to eat a ton of sushi for free at Todai for lunch today, but I can't go because we're having a lunchtime presentation at work today (boo!), so I'll have to go another time and actually pay for my food. Annie slipped a card into my bag this morning, and is coming by the office this afternoon to say happy birthday, but oddly enough I don't have any plans for tonight, because all my birthday plans are for the weekend.

Tomorrow night I'm going to see the [Presidents of the United States of America](http://www.presidentsrock.com/) at the Crystal Ballroom. Eric won tickets on the radio, and gave them to me as a present. Then on Sunday, I'm going to see [X-Men 3](http://homepage.mac.com/merussell/iblog/B835531044/C1162162177/E20060526014930/index.html), and then a party back at my place with drinks and my favorite cake (the devils-food-and-cheesecake one from our wedding).

And as if that wasn't enough, Valve is celebrating my birthday by releasing [Half-Life 2: Episode One](http://ep1.half-life2.com/) today! I've already got it preloaded at home, so maybe I'll get to spend some time playing it tonight!
