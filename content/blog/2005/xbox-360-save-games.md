Don't get too excited - this is just a render a forum-goer made after seeing a photo of a black 360 devkit. The initial launch will probably be white, though there are rumors everywhere that at some point, they may also sell a black and silver version of the 360.

I emailed Daniel about [this article](http://www.gamestay.com/stories/2005/10/16/whatsGoingToSuckAboutXbox360.html) which is claiming that there's going to be huge problems with transferring saved games from Xbox 1.0 to Xbox 360. I wasn't sure what to think of the article. On the one hand, it's written in an alarmist fashion, as Daniel pointed out to me, but on the other, it's easy to believe given the existing save game situation.

Currently, you can only transfer saved game file from one Xbox to another using the "memory unit" (sold separately) that plugs into the controller. This wouldn't be bad except not everything is transferable - unlocked costumes in Dead or Alive 3, for instance. Some files are too large to fit on the memory unit, such as Knights of the Old Republic save games, or ripped music. It's a frustrating experience replacing your Xbox as is, which means it's no stretch of the imagination to think that it would be the same way with the new Xbox.

However, Daniel pointed out that the only source this article cites is a single entry in a FAQ file. Since the 360 hasn't been released yet, it's possible this could change. Also, not everything in the article seems accurate. Daniel was on the dev. team for Whacked!, which is one of the games the article cites as having "locked" saved games that can't be copied. He hasn't heard anything about this, and finds it unlikely. (**Edit:** See the comments for further discussion on this - turns out that the saved games _can_ be locked.)

So, I'm not sure what to think. Daniel's right that we shouldn't get alarmed by a single article with weak sources. But I think it's a valid concern, given the existing problems with transferring files between two Xboxes. Hopefully this is one of those things that will prove to be a non-issue once the 360 finally arrives. And I have to admit, that this is the first real negative I've seen for the 360, while the positives form a list as long as my arm. I'll be getting one no matter what.

You know, as soon as I get a job and have some disposable income again... \*sigh\*

**Update 11/15/06:** I now have a 360 and can confirm that there's no method provided (by MS) to transfer your saved games, music, or downloaded content to your 360. Lexx has a comment below which suggests a method to do so, but I haven't tried it. Personally, I've found this isn't a big deal, because I'm not playing any of my original xbox games other than Halo2, which I'm willing to play through again.
