<p>Sadly, this page is lost to history. I don't actually remember much about this version, except that it was a geocities site, which I created using the geocities site creator, and started doing some hand-coding using tutorials from webmonkey.</p>

<p>As for content, this page may have been called "The Virtual Whatever", which was later recycled as version 2, which was shared with my roomate Trog. I don't remember anything about what was on the page, and I don't think it was online for long before I overhauled to version two.</p>
