All the pieces are falling into place. In a few months, I will be able to kick back with a cigar and proudly announce "I Love It When A Plan Comes Together!"

Yes, in just three weeks, I will be back in Portland, kicking ass and taking names (and living with my parents). Annie will be in Tacoma with her family, where she has a summer job babysitting, and is having minor surgery on her ear. Hopefully by the time her job starts in September, I will have found a cool job and a good place to live. So Operation: Portland is proceeding according to plan.

And the KillingMachines front is slowly but surely advancing. Every time I tell Steve what the next feature we need on KMorg is, he tells me there's no way that will work with the existing code, and proceeds to make it work anyway. He's like my own personal Scotty (from Star Trek). I'm working on the design features, and I'm hoping things will keep getting better every day in little ways until we're running the BEST WEBSITE EVER.

And if that wasn't enough, Studio Fojar might pick up again! Steve is very interested in finishing up a project, and when I get back to Portland I'm going to get back into it, and in addition, Urn is probably going to join our ranks! He's interested in doing artwork and level design, which is exactly what we need!

Hooray for Fojar!
