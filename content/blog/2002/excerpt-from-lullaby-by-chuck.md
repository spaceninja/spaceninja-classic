Excerpt from _Lullaby_ by Chuck Palahniuk

> Centuries ago, sailors on long voyages used to leave a pair of pigs on every deserted island. Or they'd leave a pair of goats. Either way, on any future visit, the island would be a source of meat. These islands, they were pristine. These were home to breeds of birds with no natural predators. Breeds of birds that lived nowhere else on earth. The plants there, without enemies they evolved without thorns or poisons. Without predators and enemies, these islands, they were paradise.
>
> The sailors, the next time they visited these islands, the only things still there woudl be herds of goats or pigs.
>
> Oyster is telling this story.
>
> The sailors called this "seeding meat."
>
> Oyster says, "Does this remind you of anything? Maybe the ol' Adam and Eve story?"
>
> Looking out the car window, he says, "You ever wonder when God's coming back with a lot of barbecue sauce?"
