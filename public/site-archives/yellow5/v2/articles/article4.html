<P><big>Yellow Number Five's New Album Delayed.</big>
<br><small>Blurb from <I>Blister</I> magazine.</small>

<P>Nothing seems to be going right for Yellow Number Five this week. After engaging in a costly court battle to have a porn site supposedly featuring one of their members, they discovered today that their record label, Arrakis Studios, has delayed the release of their newest album, Woman of Steel.

<P>Band leader Leo informed us that Arrakis has a valid gripe and it's just something they're going to have to work out. He apologized for the delay to fans who have been eagerly awaiting new material since they released a teaser single featuring an original Y5 song.

<P>Arrakis Studios refused to answer our calls, but our sources reveal that the label possibly has issues with the material featured on the album, fearing another international incedent like the one following the release of Gas Food Lodging.
