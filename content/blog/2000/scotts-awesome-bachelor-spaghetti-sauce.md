- two 8oz cans tomato paste.
- one can diced tomato.
- one pound ground beef.
- one small can sliced olives.
- one small can sliced mushrooms (optional).
- garlic powder, Italian seasoning.
- one large package spaghetti noodles.

1. brown meat, drain fat.
2. combine sauce mix, tomato paste, diced tomatoes (drained) in large saucepan over low heat.
3. **IMPORTANT**: add HALF the directed amount of water (the diced tomatoes, even drained, add a lot of water. If it looks too thick, you can always add more water, but you can't take it out, so start with less.
4. mix well, add beef and olives (drained).
5. mix well, add seasonings to taste.
6. Allow to simmer for as long as possible (at least an hour).
7. Serve over spaghetti noodles. Best if served with _Becky's Dining Hall Garlic Cheese Bread._
8. Makes a TON of sauce. Leftover spaghetti makes a great lunch!
