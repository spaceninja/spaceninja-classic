1. My Apple loan will be paid off by April.

2. We will be able to pay off the money we owe Mom and Dad shortly after that - No firm date yet, because we're not sure where it fits in the priority list yet, but definitely this year.
   (these two are important because those are the two debts that are weighing us down the most. once they're paid off, we'll be able to start putting some money into savings every month, and maybe even start paying off school loans)

3. We will be taking a one-night class called "Home Buying 101" at PCC on March 10th so we can find out how this all works.

4. We plan to start actively house-hunting over the summer, and depending on how a lot of other things go (finances for one) we may be moving to Washington as early as October.
