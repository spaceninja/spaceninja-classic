[Ten years ago today](/blog/1999/strange-day/), I started blogging. Since that time, this blog has [moved through four domains](http://spaceninja.local/2005/10/space-ninja-history/) and changed from being hand-rolled to using Wordpress. When I started, I thought that blogging was somewhat voyeuristic and I felt like I needed to justify why I was posting my journal online. Now, blogging is so well-established that it's actually part of my job description. In my spare time, I help maintain over 15 blogs for friends and family. It's changed from being something that felt I somewhat exhibitionist about to being something that I put on my resume. When I wrote that first post, I had no idea that was I starting to take part in something that would have such a large impact on my life, but I'm glad I did.
