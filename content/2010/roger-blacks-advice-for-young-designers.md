> "On the skillset side, what you've got to do as a young person entering the field, is really equip yourself with some basic development skills. You have to be able to understand HTML and CSS. You have to know what JavaScript can do and what it can't do. You don't necessarily have to write cool JavaScript transitions, or even in CSS, but you've got to know what you can do in each. And you've got to be able to design so that if you have a more adept coder working with you, they know you know what you're talking about." \-- [Roger Black](http://5by5.tv/pipeline/34)
