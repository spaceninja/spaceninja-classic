well, in the spirit of new things.. there's a new mozilla out ([mozilla.org](http://mozilla.org/) version 0.9.8) that's really quite snappy..

and you'll need it to properly view my new home page ([http://fojar.com/~steve/](http://fojar.com/~steve/)), because IE bless its monopolistic heart has a rendering bug in PNG graphics- it doesn't do alpha transparency, despite that being a part of the PNG standard from the start.

i'm not much of a designer but at least i got rid of the boring old text-only format i had been going for..

**Edit 10/26/2005:** We no longer control the fojar domain name, so this content is no longer available.
