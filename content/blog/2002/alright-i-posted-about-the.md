Alright, I posted about the Matrix trailer right after Zach did, and I felt silly, so I decided to edit this post. In case anyone's interested in this sort of thing, I've cleaned up and improved a few of the skins on this site. OldSchool and OldSchoolBlue are both updated to match the improvements I made on wwwKMorg. There is now only one version of the Macintosh skin, with a PHP clock. It only updates when the page refreshes, but it also doesn't suck up bandwidth. And there's a brand new skin called Trinity, which is actually a design I made for \[http://trinity.killingmachines.org/\], but since Trinity is horribly unpopular, I copied it here.

If you haven't already, go watch [The Matrix Reloaded teaser trailer one](http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/rl_cmp/trailer_qt.html).

Good thing I have Attack of the Clones to keep my mind occupied.
