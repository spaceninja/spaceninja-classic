<P><big>False Amy Porn Site Taken Down.</big>

<P>The band expressed disdain today when asked their feeling on the recent events surrounding a highly controversial website that succeeded in having removed from the web. The site in question claimed to be a pornogrophy site hosting photos of the band's only female member, Amy Johnson.

<P>The site claimed to be run by Amy herself, and feature her "and her friends" in all sorts of "nasty" situations. The photos ranged from mildly erotic photos of "Amy" stripping, to hardcore images of "Amy" being penetrated by her "friend's" fist. "Sucking, Fucking, and Fun" was the headline spread over a photo of "Amy" giving oral sex to another woman.

<P>The band took the owner of the site to court, and succeeded in getting it removed. The owner, a quiet webmaster from Portland by the name of Zack Radisch, refused comment.

<P>The band's largest member Big Ed seemed angered over the site. "This is just rediculous. Anyone who knows Amy knows she would never put up a site like this. The girl doesn't even look like her, for Christ's sake. Amy's been horribly broken up over this, and the rest of us are pretty angry."

<P>The band's new lead singer, Leo, had a slightly different take. "Sure, we're all upset, but now that the site's down, there's no real harm done. Um, besides, that girl was kinda cute. I mean, hey, if you interview her or anything, do you think you could give her my phone number?"

<P>Amy herself refused comment, and the band's fourth member, David, was missing. In a phone interview conducted before the case, however, David was quoted as saying that the "ironic thing about all this is that Colossus would have been all over this. He would have wanted us to put up a REAL porn site, with ALL of us on it."
