I'm getting tired of shirts that are too small for me (stupid gut! I shouldn't have to buy XL shirts to house you!), and I'm definitely tired of how many white shirts I have. They get beat up too fast, and they just kinda look trashy. These shirts are pretty much all colorful, which I think will help.
