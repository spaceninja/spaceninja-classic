[![Very Comfortable](/images/kittens/IMG_2987.jpg)](/images/kittens/IMG_2987.jpg)

I've been resisting the urge to turn this into a cat-blog fairly well. Truth be told, Annie being pregnant might have something to do with that, but it hasn't stopped the kittens from being adorable. They're still very playful, although they have started settling down at night a bit. Their schedule consists of getting up with us, running crazy for an hour or so, napping all day, and then running crazy for an hour when we get home, followed by more napping until we go to bed, when they proceed to run crazy until they fall asleep at the foot of the bed.

If you would like to see more photos, and even a couple of movies, check out the growing [kitty album](/images/kittens/).
