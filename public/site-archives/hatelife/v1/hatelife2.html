this is dedicated to matthew.  matthew is a starving college student, trying
to win over the heart of his love, jennifer.  matthew was raised like all
good boys, to be a gentleman.  he's courteous, he's genial, and he laughs at
jennifer's jokes even when they're stupid.  he'd open doors for her and help
her out of the car, too, but she's sick right now, so she's staying at home
in bed.<p>

jennifer appreciates how matthew comes to visit her even when she's sick,
and she likes the hot tea and soup he's prepared for her.  they may watch a
movie tonight, or they might play a game of cards.  jennifer thinks of
him as a good friend.  matthew has fallen too hard for her.  he masks his
feeling well, but he leaves a tiny question mark hanging at the edge her
consciousness.  she may ask herself, "does he think..?  no, he couldn't.
he knows about daniel."<p>

daniel is a thousand miles away, studying russian lit and driving his 1987
grand-am to the office where he processes film for a one-hour instant photo
center.  he and jennifer have been seeing each other for about six months,
and he's looking forward to seeing her again on fall break.<p>

the evening has passed.  matthew took care of jennifer (where was daniel
now, he bitterly asks himself), and laughed at her dumb joke.  and she
thanked him, and told him how much she liked his company.  he smiled and
replied in kind, even though his heart was breaking.<p>

jennifer went to bed, and matthew drove home alone.<p>
