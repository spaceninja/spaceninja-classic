As is being reported by [Sean](http://nyarlo.net/2006/05/f-bomb/) and [Binary Bonsai](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/05/04/star-wars-theatrical-release-on-dvd/) and many other sites, the [theatrical versions of the original Star Wars trilogy will be released on DVD](http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/release/video/news20060503.html) in September. It will include the 2004 remastered release, and will only be available from September 12th to December 31st. I already have the boxset of the 2004 version, but I might have to pick this up anyways - the chance to own the original version is pretty tempting.
