[![Stop the Usual Defects](/images/2863900422_374ce4c819.jpg)](http://www.stoptheusualdefects.com/)

About six month ago, we launched the first version of [Stop the Usual Defects](http://www.stoptheusualdefects.com/), a microsite for LP to promote the launch of their new engineered wood product, LSL. The concept was to showcase the strengths of LSL by portraying defects in traditional lumber in the style of The Usual Defects. We just reworked the site for the addition of a new trailer, and the redesign is pretty cool. The idea is to look like a detective's corkboard with strings connecting photos of various suspects, or in our case, sections of the site. We used a new jQuery method to let the user click on the string and have the browser automatically scroll over to the next section. The tricky bit is that the site still works just fine if you disable javascript. It's a bit of a processor hog, but I'm quite pleased with the finished effect.

Oh, and make sure you scroll down to read the movie credits. Our copywriter had a lot of fun with all the names.
