What is the truth about rock music? Music is a powerful and perhaps the most powerful medium in the world. Music. Plato said "When the music of a society changes, the whole society will change." Aristotle, a contemporary of Plato said "When music changes, there should be laws to govern the nature and the character of that music." Lenin said "The best and the quickest way to undermine a society is through it's music." Music, ladies and gentlemen, is a gift of God. It was given by man to offer praises to God and to lift us up to him and to exalt him and so we can touch the tender recesses of our heart and of our mind. Satan has taken music and he has counterfeited it, convoluted it, twisted it, exploited it and now he's using it to hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer a message into the minds and lifestyles of this generation.
