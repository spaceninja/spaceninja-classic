Leilani's been taking two-hour naps the past day or so.

She started doing that a few weeks before we left Brooklyn, but stopped during all the travel and hubbub. She's also been sleeping in our bed with us because she won't sleep anywhere else.

But Sunday, she slept for two hours by herself, and then again yesterday and today. That's a good sign.

She's still sleeping in our bed, but neither of us mind: she's pretty snuggly.
