That's caffeine. Caffeine is my very close friend right now. Yes, I am finishing another one of my many incompletes from last year.

Yes, I am a college student.

You know that feeling you get, when you're about to remember that you locked yourself out of the house? I get that a lot. No, I do not lock myself out. It's more like my focus is too narrow, and, after I finish all these classes, will I look around and notice that my world has rotted?

You have to wear blinders sometimes to stay on track.

But damn.
