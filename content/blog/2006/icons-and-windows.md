The [icon-and-window style of interacting with files](http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Rosings_Rascals.txt&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date) on a computer was developed frantically over two weeks during the initial development on the Apple Lisa, and nearly got cancelled at the last minute. It's funny how many things that we think of as definitive in the computer world, started as a gamble or a fluke.
