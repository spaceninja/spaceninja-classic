soooo...I'm a major lame-o this week. :) yesterday I accidentally didn't make it in to work because I had set my alarm for 7:00 pm, not am. so I lept out of bed at 8:10, called my leader and spent the rest of the day feeling dumb. He just laughed at my worry fortunately, saying he'll probably do that at some point this year too. oh well, I did get some important phone calls and emails made. I get to make up some of the hours I missed on sat. helping out with some yard work for Cascade Aids Project. thaat'll be cool. So today everything was fine, got to work on time after 4 hours of sleep,and we took off to forest park in the pouring down rain to do trail work. Jenny was showing us where we were working, and what needed to be done, like some logs removed and the trails widened and stuff. there were some trees over the trail and someone sawed them in half and I was helping push them down the hill when I lost my footing and slipped, slightly twisting my ankle. my luck sucks this week. one of the girls on my team has emt training, so she took me back to the van and iced and bandaged it up and I sat in the warm, dry van with my foot up, doing the crosswords. which I almost completed btw. I did manage to help for about an hour after lunch, when my foot was all taped up nice and secure, but it's still a little shaky. ma and grum, don't freak out, I'll be fine, if it still bothers me at work tomorrow, I'm going to the doc. and scott's dad will give me a ride to work, so I don't have to put any extra strain on it. we'll see how the rest of the week goes. keep your fingers crossed!
