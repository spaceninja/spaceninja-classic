Now that I'm on a DSL connection, I keep noticing a slight lag between the time that Opera displays the text of a webpage, and the time that it applies the stylesheets . . . for about half a second, the blog comes up all '95 style, with serif fonts stretching all the way across the page, images aligned to the left, and nary a frame or table box to be found.

Then it's like SNAP!! and the style sheets yank everything into place, the font changes, and the magic colors and highlights appear.

It's kinda cool.
