Things That Have Been Distracting Scott From Posting To Rusted:

- [StarHunter](http://www.starhuntertv.com/) - This is a sci-fi show about a crew of stellar bounty hunters who fly around in a retrofitted luxury cruiser. It started airing in the US (originally from Canada, eh) about the same time as Firefly, that sci-fi show from the guy who made Buffy. I never watched it because the main character and his bodyguard look the same on both shows, so after watching 20 minutes of firefly, I kept thinking it was the same show. Turns out StarHunter is much better.
- [The Sims Online](http://www.thesimsonline.com/) - Okay, I've only goofed around with this for about 10 minutes since my playtest disc showed up. Truthfully, any time I've been spending gaming has been spent on Grand Theft Auto III... and maybe soon on the expansion pack.
- [Thinking About Buying A Dishwasher](http://www.epinions.com/hmgd-Dishwashers-Frigidaire-Portable_Dishwasher/display_~reviews) - Turns out there's such a thing as a _portable_ dishwasher. By portable, all they mean is that it has the other three side panels put on, and it has wheels so it can be moved out of the way when it's not connected to the sink.
- Getting ready to buy health insurance, and getting paranoid that something bad will happen before I can.
- Wedding Planning - Annie's mom and aunt were visiting this weekend, so we were doing a lot of planning. Over the next few days, we'll apparently be meeting with the caterer and several potential officiants.
- Being cold - The temperature in Portland has plummeted over the last week or two, and I'm still balancing the heater settings to get our house the right temperature. There's approximately a 1 millimeter area on the knob that is a livable temperature. Below that, the heater just turns off, and above that, it runs non-stop all the time. So it takes a bit of finesse to ease it into the spot for, say, 72 instead of 66.

Anyways, that's what's going on here. I always feel bad when I don't post anything but links for too long, so I'm going to try to start posting more content.
