we found out a few days ago that my brother's daughter was born a week and a half ago. she's healthy, and that is definitely a good thing. it looks like the first chapter in this ongoing saga is closing, too, which makes me very happy.

(i can fill in the interested parties on what's going on between ted and dawn at scott's or something.)
