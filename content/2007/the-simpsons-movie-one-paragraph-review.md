If you like the show, you'll like the movie. Enough said for most people. Nearly every character makes an appearance, and all the bits you would expect are here, plus some excellent new stuff with Homer's pet pig. However, I can't help feeling that South Park made the transition to the big screen better by adapting the show to the new format, rather than just making a 90-minute episode. I'm not saying that this should have been a musical (though the monorail song would have been nice), but on the whole, this feels like it's missing some critical spark to really push it over the edge. Still, lots of great moments and quotable lines to keep the die-hard fans happy. Plus, I'll be humming the Spider-Pig theme song for days.
