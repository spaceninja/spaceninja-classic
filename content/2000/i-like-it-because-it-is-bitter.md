> In the desert I saw a creature, naked, bestial, Who, squatting upon the ground, Held his heart in his hands, And ate of it. I said, "Is it good, friend?" "It is bitter -- bitter," he answered; "But I like it "Because it is bitter, "And because it is my heart." \-- Stephen Crane, from The Black Riders and Other Lines
