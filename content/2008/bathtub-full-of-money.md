> "â€¦Not because I'm some patchouli-scented, fuzzy-headed, 'information wants to be free' info-hippie. I'm at it because I want to fill my bathtub with money and rub my hands and laugh and laugh and laugh." \--[Cory Doctorow](http://www.chrisjdavis.org/quote-from-cory-dotcorow), from the forward of Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town
