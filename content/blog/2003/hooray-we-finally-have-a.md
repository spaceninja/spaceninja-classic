hooray, we finally have a new name that we all like - one with some very cool history, that doesn't tie us down to any specific region of music, one that's both pronounceable and foreign-sounding. and we have a slogan to match.

we're now calling ourselves the Ensemble Berceanu - named after our fiddler's great-grandfather. he was the village fiddler in the old world, and lead the Ensemble Berceanu in his home village of just a couple hundred people. our slogan is: Weddings, Funerals, Revolutions, and Bris.

so i can finally print up some business cards to give out after our shows. and set up our website. we're already talking about making a cd - we've got about a set's worth of really solid material now, and we're adding more all the time. oh! and our bass player's going to line up some awesome big-time shows for us, where we can open for major acts at the satyricon or the roseland. (i'd like to play dante's, myself.) for those of you outside portland, these are big venues.

very exciting times....

(hey scott, can we upgrade rusted to f5k as soon as possible? yes, we are doing so!)
