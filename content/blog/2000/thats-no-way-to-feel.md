Things with Annie are better now. Fights are strange things. They seem really important at the time, but later you wonder what all the fuss was about. Sure, I'm still irritated, and she's made it clear to me that she still feels strongly about her points, but it seems silly now that we had an ugly evening over it.

The thing I hate most about fighting with someone is being able to watch yourself from the logical part of your mind, and see the emotional part say or do something really really dumb, and not being able to stop yourself. Knowing that you're acting irrationally and doing it anyway is a horrible feeling.

Steve, KT, pixie and I all hung out at KT's place tonight and watched movies. We rented Bowfinger and Black Belt Jones, which we watched first. It's amazing. There is a fight scene at a broken car wash where everyone is chest deep in soap suds and there is excessive use of slow-motion.

Blaxploitation film heroes are awesome because they can get away with stuff that more politically correct heroes nowadays couldn't do. Jim Kelly gets to take all his brothas to McDonalds with the money they stole from the Mob, and gets it on with the leading lady at the beach after they exchange insults and she slaps him a few times. Richard Roundtree, the grandmaster stud of all movie studs (even James Bond) ends up in bed with one of his ladies, explaining that he "got to feeling like a machine, baby... and that's no way to feel."

Damn Right.
