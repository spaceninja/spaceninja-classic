[Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/) and [Shel Israel](http://redcouch.typepad.com/) wrote this self-professed sequel to _The Cluetrain Manifesto_, focusing on blogging in the business world. As you might expect if you've ever read Scoble's blog, the book clearly advocates blogging for companies, but they also point out some of the most common pitfalls and reasons not to blog (such as if you have something to hide). If you're already a blogger, most of this will seem self-evident, but if you're trying to craft a blogging policy for your company, or convince your CEO to blog, this book can be a huge help. In fact, I'm about to submit a blogging policy proposal to our company's president based largely on what this has to say, and I'm loaning him the book, too. _(If this book were a college course, it would be 200 level, with Cluetrain Manifesto as recommended reading.)_
