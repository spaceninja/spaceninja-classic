Well, it's official - the server is dead.

Over the last two hours I've tried everything imaginable, and it will not allow me to upgrade or reinstall FreeBSD. I'm forced to the conclusion that there's been some sort of hardware failure that's beyond my abilities to fix, and beyond my finances to replace.

Over the next day or two, I will be working to move all my websites to the new hosting, and to find a way to put up all the KMorg journals in archive form so people can download them to use elsewhere.

On a related note, I was going to recommend that users get a livejournal or blogger account and import their KMorg journals, but neither of those sites allows importing. So I was going to recommend they find a host that will let them install Movable Type - but they just changed their licenses to where it's no longer free unless you're running a single-author weblog (meaning rusted may not be upgraded to the new version).

Anyways, there's still some thought to be done on my part about what to do with the killingmachines.org domain - There's a possibility that I will allow it to be hosted somewhere else and give someone else the dubious priviledge of running the site - the only problem is that would take Rusted with it... So maybe Rusted will get a new URL, maybe lots of things will change, maybe nothing will change. I don't know for sure yet.

Oh, and the whole "falling apart" thing is better now. I'm not going to get into it, but suffice to say things were very stressful around here for awhile for a variety of reasons, and they're slowly improving. I don't feel quite so out of control now.

Anyways, I'll post more later when I'm a little more sure what the next step is.
