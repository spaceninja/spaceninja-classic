This is old news by now, because I'm a lazy parent-blogger, but Zoe has (long-since) given up her crib and moved into a toddler bed. We bought her a very nice bed for her second birthday, and she loves sleeping in it.

Most nights, bedtime involves one parent (usually Annie) handling bath, teeth, and reading books, and then the other (usually myself) handling lights-out. I offer her an option every night to curl up in bed or have me hold her while she falls asleep, and it's pretty much 50/50 which one she chooses. She's happy to lie in her bed, listening to the Garden State soundtrack, but if I try to sneak out before she's all the way asleep, she'll call me back, saying "No, Papa NOT leave."

She's usually asleep within a half-hour, and then sleeps in her bed for anywhere from 2-6 hours, at which point she wakes up, and Annie brings her to bed with us. More and more, she tending to sleep through the night, but she's only ever spent the entire night in her room once so far.
