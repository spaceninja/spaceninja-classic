During the Vice Presidential debate, Dick Cheney said that "They know that if you go, for example, to [factcheck.com](http://www.factcheck.com/) ... you can get the specific details with respect to Halliburton." The only problem is that [factcheck.com](http://www.factcheck.com/) actually redirects to [GeorgeSoros.com](http://www.georgesoros.com/), with a front-page message of "Why We Must Not Re-Elect President Bush." The website Cheney was thinking of was [factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/). The Bush team keeps the embarrassing slip-ups coming!
