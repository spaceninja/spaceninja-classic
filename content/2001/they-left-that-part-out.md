Yet another example of computer manual writers leaving out the most important bit of information:

My boss asks me to print up some envelopes with our business address on the laser printer. He hands me a box of envelopes. I check the printer manual, and quickly find the two pages about how to print on envelopes. The manual tells me which side has to be loaded facing up, which side has to enter first, and so on. So I put in a stack of about 25 envelopes and set it printing. Then I notice that the envelopes are stacking funny. Normally, the pile is larger on the side with the flap. Now the pile is smaller on that side. I suspiciously pick up an envelope and discover that the heat from the printer has SEALED the envelope shut. The glue was still hot, so I managed to open it, no problem, but you'd think there would be a warning in the manual that after the printer runs for awhile, it gets hot, and could SEAL THE ENVELOPES SHUT. That's a fairly important piece of information, I'd say.
