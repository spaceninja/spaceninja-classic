As my faithful readers will remember, I ordered [Burn](http://www.threadless.com/product/70.html) from Threadless a little while back, and got gypped 'cause their "active stock list" isn't really designed to handle hundreds of people buying at once, and they had a big sale, and thus a run on tee-shirts.

But . . . being the nice guys that they are, they sent me a $5 off coupon for my next purchase, and I got put on the mailing list for any reprints of Burn they might do.

Which they just did. For which said update e-mail I just received. Thereuponwhich I ordered the shirt, forthwith.

With the discount.

Yee-haw!
