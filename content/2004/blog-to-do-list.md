I'm hoping to plow through a lot of this over the weekend.

- Clean up sidebar code
- Clean up footer code
- Clean up header code (F. Image Replacement?)
- Finish cleaning templates for clean valid XHTML
- Apply extra formatting to archive pages (author icons, edit links, etc.)
- Fix broken links from admin move
- Final tweaks to stylesheet for typography

And here are the changes that probably won't happen this weekend, but I want to finish up very soon.

- Create second CSS design
- Modify templates to allow skinning via cookie and stylesheet
- Research thumbnail options for photoblog
- Finish setting up photoblog
- Add "recent photos" to sidebar

When I'm done with all of that, I'm going to copy the template changes and tweaks I made over to the other MT sites I set up, and then work on some web design for KT, Sean, and Newsbeat.
