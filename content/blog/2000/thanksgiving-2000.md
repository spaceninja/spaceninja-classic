Yesterday was kick-ass! We decided to have a local thanksgiving dinner with friends, and the whole thing just kept getting bigger. I guess everyone thought it was a good idea, because everyone came! We had two turkeys, like three bowls of stuffing, and a ton of other food.

Annie and I were there, of course, and Annie's parents came, with her two bothers. Then Eric and Jill (and Gavin) came over, and then Urn and Kat showed up with Urn's mom, and then Jesse and a friend showed up.

It was great. I was a little nervous as we frantically cleaned the house, but it went really well. Everyone was laid back and seemed to have fun. We watched Thumb Wars (a star wars parody), The Grinch, and goofed around on [Am I Hot Or Not](http://www.amihotornot.com/). At least, that's what we geeks did. I'm not sure what all the women and adults were doing, except that Kat and Annie did their usual trick of disappearing into a bathroom together, emerging ten minutes later wearing each other's clothing and giggling.

On Wednesday night, we're hitching a ride to Tacoma with Urn and Kat to visit Annie's family. Dave and Zach (Annie's bothers) are already plotting to see how many computers they can get together so they can do a lot of network gaming. Should be fun!

Oh, and Urn and I will probably find out today whether or not we get the specialty show.
