The Gap has a crazy website up called [Watch Me Change](http://www.watchmechange.com/), where you design a person, like in the Sims and pick an outfit for them. Then they walk out of the changing room, do a rather lengthy dance, and then walk into the changing room and put on the outfit you chose. However, the outfit you chose it only on screen for about 30 seconds, compared to the two minutes or so of dancing in the default outfit. And given how bad the guys look dancing, compared to the stripper moves the girls pull out, combined with the breast jiggling that's built into the animation, it leads me to conclude this is an effort to get more guys shopping at the Gap.

Of course, none of this stopped Annie and I from designing this charming overweight little fellow with his mullet, moustach and hipster glasses, and forcing him to dance for our amusement.
