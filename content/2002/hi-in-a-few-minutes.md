Hi! In a few minutes, I will have completed my 12-track professional demo CD!

(Actually the tracks aren't mastered yet, so the sound quality may be a bit dodgy on some songs. But anyway.)

If you're coming to dinner tonight, and you want a copy of this fabulous treat, please reply to this message, or send me e-mail. In exchange, I ask that you give me an honest opinion of the disc, since this is an important career move for me, and the more input I can get, the better!

**_Update:_** The entire CD is now downloadable/streamable in mp3 form! CheX0r:
