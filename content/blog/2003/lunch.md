hooray! i'm actually finally really working downtown. now if only any of my friends worked downtown, too ;) who's up for chu's!

_update!_ i'm now enjoying a bounty of delecacies and treats of special regard, because the clients we just finished up a site for sent us a monstrous fruit basket to say 'thanks'! this "working in the office" thing is so chock full of benefits. ;)
