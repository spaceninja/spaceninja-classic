I don't get sick very often, so when I do, it usually takes me completely by surprise. I'm one of those people who gets a few colds and maybe a touch of the flu each year, but is fine most of the time. I've also never really had any major health-related things happen to me. I've never broken a bone, and I only had stitches once on a cut in my lip when I fell off my bike. I never had my tonsils out, or my appendix. I've never had Measles, or even Chicken Pox. My mom told me once: "You don't have to worry. You had chicken pox when you were just a baby. But we weren't sure, because it might have been Strep Throat." Then she took me to the hospital to get a chicken pox vaccination. What the Fuck? How can you not tell the difference between Chicken Pox and Strep Throat?!? One gives you a really bad sore throat and one COVERS YOUR BODY IN LITTLE ITCHY RED SPOTS!!!!

Anyway, as a result of this, every time I get sick, I get a little paranoid that maybe what feels like a simple stomach cramp is really my appendix bursting, and slowly filling my body with poison. I'm always a little worried that I'm going to have all these horrible things happen to me, in a way that most people who went through all this shit as a kid don't have to think about.

\*\* hatelife is having chicken pox, or maybe strep throat \*\*
