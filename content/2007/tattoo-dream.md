Last night I had a dream that I was sitting in bed reading comics when I found a full-page illustration that I really liked. At the time, I had the impression that it was a Hellboy comic. I decided that I would tattoo the image onto my shoulder. As I started drawing the outlines, right there in bed, using a mirror, I figured the finished tattoo would be about the size of a normal comic book. About a quarter of the way through the tattoo, as I was filling in a large area of green ink, I realized I was really sleepy, and wouldn't be able to finish the job, so I went to bed. When I woke up, I found out that Annie had brought in a tattoo artist to finish the job for me. The tattoo artist looked exactly like [Adam Corrola's friend Ray](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/1366092119/) from his construction show. He waited patiently on the bed with Annie and Zoe as I tore the house apart looking for the comic.

After what seemed like hours of looking, I found it in my parents' basement, which was in our basement. Suprisingly, the comic turned out to be about Halo, and was about half the size of a normal comic. I returned to the bedroom and took off my shirt to show the guy what I had done already, warning him not to laugh, since this was the first time I had used a tattoo gun. However, I was shocked to find that instead of a smallish scene involving Hellboy or the Master Chief, I had a _gigantic_ scene spread across my chest, and all the way down my left arm. At the top, the field of green that I had been drawing turned out to be the Green Lantern, flying towards me like Superman, with a large battle scene below him of other Green Lanterns fighting various monsters. It wasn't even the classic-looking Green Lantern, it was the more recent version with the [horrible new uniform](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/1366092277/) and the redone logo. I was laughing as I looked at it, but I felt like crying, because, "Oh my god, I tattooed Green Lantern on my chest."
