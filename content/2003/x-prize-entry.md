This photo is of [SpaceShipOne](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_66.html), one of the first entries competing for [The X-Prize](http://www.xprize.org/), a contest offering 10 million dollars to the first team that can "privately build and launch a spaceship able to carry three people to 100 kilometer altitude, return safely to Earth, and repeat the launch in 2 weeks."

Also, it looks cool.

\* _Note:_ I just discovered [another site](http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap030627.html) that has a larger view of the crew module!

\* _Update!_ I just found a whole slew of new photos on the X-Prize's [team site for Scaled Composites](http://www.xprize.org/teams/scaled.html), the team that built SpaceShipOne, and I couldn't resist posting this shot of the cockpit!
