I'm working on Zoe's second birthday post, but in the meantime, let me share this classic Zoe video with you. I recently uploaded a slew of videos to Flickr as part of my new year's resolution, and I think this one is my new favorite. She's three months old, and I'm trying to get a video of her baby babbling, but she's decided she's tired of looking at me, so she's turned her head to the side and is looking at the window. But watch her eyebrows as I talk. You can tell she's still paying attention, because every time I say something, her eyebrows shoot up!
