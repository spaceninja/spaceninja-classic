                <br><b>Scott 1993</b>: These are all really funny! Where did you get them?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: The majority are things I've found on the internet or had emailed to me. There are a few exceptions, though.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Hey! Pen-No-Pen! I just made this up!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Yeah, I was sorting through some old documents I had and stumbled across that and decided to post it. That's also when I rediscovered Obeso the Pirate here.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: I was wondering about that. It's really funny, but it doesn't look like something you found on a website.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Two guys you know in high school are going to write that in a year or so. I remember thinking it was hilarious when it first came out. Now I find the humor kind of immature, but I keep it here to remind myself what high school was like.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Isn't that the name you use to post to <a href="http://www.hatelife.org/view.php?user=obeso+the+pirate">hatelife</a>?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Yeah. It seemed like a fairly anonymous nick, since no one has ever read this text file but me. Now I kinda like the nick.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Well, you have put on some weight since high school…

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Shut up. You'll be here someday. I'm going to start running again in about a week, once the term's over.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Are you insane? Radick talked me into joining track with him, and it's killing me! I'd quit if I hadn't had to pay $20!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Next year he talks you into joining cross-country and you do that for three years. Every year you complain about the money and stuff, but you still join, and when it's over, you miss it. Plus, you get in really good shape and your legs look awesome.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Yeah, this one chick was complimenting me on them the other day… it was kinda cool!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Woah! Watch out for her! She's a skank! She dumps you after you sleep together! Use protection!

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: What???

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Oh, maybe that was later on. Um… never mind. Forget I said anything.
