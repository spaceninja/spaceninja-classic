About a week ago, Annie and I went to check out the place where we're going to get married. It's a gorgeous spot on the Columbia Gorge called [Bridal Veil Lakes](http://www.bridalveillakes.com/). There's a covered patio area, and lots of room for tables and food and stuff for the reception, but the real nice feature is a large area of well-groomed lawns and flower beds surrounding a nice little lake. While we were there, my dad took some really nice photos, which Annie has posted on [her website](/images/bridal_veil_tour/). Here are four photos that I really liked, if you don't feel like rummaging through the whole directory.
