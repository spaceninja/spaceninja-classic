Sorry for the lack of posts lately. It's been a crazy week, and I just haven't been able to bring myself to sit down and type a post.

I've basically been playing catch-up all week at work, and this morning I finally caught up. I was feeling pretty good about that until my boss decided to chew me out for something without telling me what I was being chewed out for. And so the passive-agressive cycle continues.

I haven't gotten any web design done in the last week, and I haven't been keeping my other goals that I set for myself. The good news is that instead, Annie and I have basically started a spring cleaning kick, and we've made good progress, even though we still have a lot to do. We tackled the dining room table, which was covered in all the stuff I got out of my parent's basement, and all my old art projects from middle school through college. We cleaned her office, and then swapped the desks so that she would have a desk deep enough for my 19" monitor, which I wasn't using since my new computer came with a 17" LCD monitor. (The computer is a Dell Dimension 4600 2.8 GHz P4 with 1.2 GB of RAM if anyone cares).

Oh, and all that DNS nonsense is starting to sort itself out. As I kind of suspected, the problem was in several places, but they're starting to resolve themselves once I straightened things out at the registrar. From here, things will only get better, and I now know how to add/remove domains and subdomains and nameservices on my server. It's still a pain in the ass, but it's a pain that I feel slightly more confident about at the moment.

The other night I was hanging out with Eric and Jill, and their friend Jeff mentioned to Jill that OPB Radio is looking for volunteers to fill airtime, and Jill and I decided to apply for a weekly news show. We worked on the news together in Ellensburg, so we're familiar with the territory. She'll do the writing, and I'll do the reading.

Jill has been having Annie and I over for the last week or two to watch episodes of the original Starsky and Hutch TV show, in preparation for the movie. The other night, we finally went to see it, and it's excellent. I was dying at several parts, and Will Farrel has a great bit part in it. The best part is definitely how many of the little things they managed to retain from the TV show, like how Ben Stiller just _nails_ Starsky's way of running and shooting. And of course, Snoop Dogg is **perfect** as Huggy Bear.

We also saw _Hellboy_ on opening night with KT, Miles, and Sean. We had mixed feelings about it. The parts that were accurate to the comic were great, but they added a lot of goofy stuff that didn't really seem to fit, and it was _way_ too long. Sean and KT thought it could have done with either a bit less plot, or just limiting the plot to the story from the first comic. I thought it would have worked well chopped up into half-hour segments and aired as a TV show. Still, overall it was a lot of fun, and worth seeing - it just didn't live up to Sean's and my high expectations.

Ryan and Molli finally purchased their plane tickets, so we know for sure that they will be in Portland by the end of the month, which means I will get to see my neice again, and be stunned at the fact that she's twice the size as when I last saw her.

Hmm... I'm probably forgetting some stuff, but I'm a little tired right now, and don't care that much. I'll post anything I forgot tomorrow. Oh, and I'll add some before-and-after photos of the dining room and our offices.
