Alex brought over _The Matrix Revisited_ tonight, so we got to watch it. Mostly more behind the scenes stuff but with a load of hints about the upcoming movies. Without ever explaining what was going on, we saw some shots of the following:  
\- Car chases  
\- Motorcycle chases  
\- Morpheus practicing with a sword(!)  
  
In addition, they said that they are working on a Matrix computer game with "the most realistic kung-fu moves yet," choreographed by the fight choreographer from the movies. Also, _AniMatrix_, a collection of animated short films by major japanese animators, including one written by the guy who did _Ninja Scroll_ and _Vampire Hunter D_, as well as one that is sort of a prequel to the Matrix, that tells about the war between man and machine.  
  
These films will probably be released on [the website](http://www.whatisthematrix.com/) first, though there is no mention there or on the DVD about whether they will charge for them, or if they'll be free like the comics, which they are currently producing a third series of.
