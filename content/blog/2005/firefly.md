> "This was designed to be a TV series because I wanted to tell the boring stories about Han Solo smuggling when he wasn't involved with the Rebellion, I wanted to tell the stories about the people who live in between and the stories themselves that live in between the greater stories. After the initial idea for the pilot, I increased the cast from five to nine members so that I could generate stories from within the ship and not have to constantly go out to new and exciting worlds and guest stars that we couldn't afford, and I made every planet Planet Earth so that we didn't have to go to Yucca Flats and pretend it was an alien planet every other week. It was a deliberately television idea."
