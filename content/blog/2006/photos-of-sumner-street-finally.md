It took way too long, but here are the long-promised photos of our new place! I uploaded a bunch of photos into a gallery here, and even added descriptions to all the photos. Just click on the big photo above to view the gallery. I'll try to get a floorplan up soon, to help make sense of these.

While I was at it, I also uploaded some cute photos of the kittens and of Oskar. Click on any of the thumbnails below to see a larger version.
