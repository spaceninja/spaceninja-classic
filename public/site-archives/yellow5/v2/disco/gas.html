<big>Gas Food Lodging - Arrakis Records</big>

<P>Gas Food Lodging was released in July 1996, shortly after band member Melissa Foster's death.  It was met with immediate notoriety, after the cover of Linger by the Cranberries was outlawed in all 50 states as well as Ireland and Great Britain.  The band refused to alter the song in any way, and Arrakis was forced to recover it's losses by releasing a special "blackout" version of the album, with the track left blank, and the name of the song blacked out.  The band made no comment about the blackout version of the album.  The Blackout version of the album is no challenge to find, but to get the original release, you may have to travel to some third-world country, risking infectuous tropical diseases and civil warfare.  But you would gladly risk life and limb just to posess this wonderful song, wouldn't you?
