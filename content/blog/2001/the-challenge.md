Scott, maybe I phrased my last "come-on" a bit too weakly.

I CHALLENGE you to a comics DUEL, you pixel-doubling, cut-n-pasting, final-fantasy-character abusing, limp-wristed Deus Ex junkie! Let's GO! I will upload my vicious, below-the-belt satire of Hammerspace within the week, and I expect you to reply in kind with a spiteful mockery of Isometric or be forever deemed a waif-hearted exemplar of pusillanimity by all your friends and relatives. Style, content, haircut of author — nothing is sacred! Pistols at dawn, fool! — Miles
