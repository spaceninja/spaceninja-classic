Annie and I are spending the week at the lovely [Running Y Ranch](http://www.runningy.com/) in Klamath Falls this week for our yearly anniversary trip with Urn & Kat and Dave & Rose. I'll be too busy seeing Crater Lake for the first time to make any posts, but when I get back I should have plenty of photos. See you in a week!

**Update:** And we're back! I'll be uploading photos and writing a post in the next day or two.
