**background:** Jester has referred scott to a potential web design employer.

**Jester:** So, I was talking to \[potential employer\] and he said he had been looking at your sites. Then he asked me what kind of a person you were. And I knew exactly what he was worried about.

**scott:** what?

**Jester:** Well, he'd looked at your [obey fojar](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/obey/v2/) stuff, and there's one [image](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/obey/v2/files/tanks.m.php) of Steve with one fist raised.

**scott (seeing where this is going):** \*laughing\* oh, no...

**Jester:** And then there's [Killing Machines](http://www.killingmachines.org). And [hatelife](http://www.hatelife.org/).

**scott:** Oh my god! He thinks I'm a Nazi or something!

**Jester:** Well, I think he thought more just like you were depressed or goth or something.

**scott:** Well, you told him I'm just a normal guy, right?

**Jester:** No, I told him the truth, why?
