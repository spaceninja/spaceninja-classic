Hi guys,
We've been having a lot of server problems lately, but Steve and I are hopeful that we fixed them on Monday. However, I'm still getting scattered reports that people can't access pages on killingmachines, or even fojar at all. Can anyone who's got a few seconds please try loading the following URLs and let me know if you have any problems?
\[http://www.fojar.com/\]
\[http://www.hatelife.org/\]
\[http://www.killingmachines.org/\]
