Did I say that nothing ever happened to me except for seeing movies and updating websites? Last night, Steve let me know that the motherboard on fojar was dying, so this morning, after three hours of sleep (due to backing up everything on fojar), Steve and I drove out to Frys, where we managed to replace the fojar hardware for less than $200. Now fojar is super fast and actually a beefier machine that either Steve's or my desktop computer. Then we came back to my house, where people started gradually coming over and assembling our big meal. Steve and I had a couple of drinks, and ended up getting quite drunk. Now it's almost 2 in the morning, there's vomit on the floor in the bathroom where Steve passed out, there's beer on the carpet where some beer bottles got knocked over, there's bright red wax splattered on the wall where I knocked over a candle, and I've got a floppy disk full of blackmail photos. Here's some of the winners, including Steve sucking precious spilled alcohol out of a napkin, some action shots of us doing shoulder rolls in the living room, and one charming photo of Zima posing with Steve, who is passed out on the floor of our bathroom.
