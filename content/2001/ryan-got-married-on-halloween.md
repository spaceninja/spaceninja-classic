**If my brother is married, then I'm [Superman.](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3188718237/)**

Yesterday, sometime before noon on this coast, Ryan and Molli went and got married. They did it at a justice of the peace, and I don't actually know much more than that because we haven't spoken since then (he just left us a phone message). Mom said they're going to do a honeymoon kind of thing at some nice place in the area, but I can't remember the name. Maybe next time Ryan gets online he'll reply to this and fill me in.

Last night, [Annie](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3189562396/) [and I](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3188718201/) got together with [Daniel](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3188718215/) to go see _Ghostbusters_ at a theatre pub. Once we got there, we found out the projector was broken, so we made Daniel rent _Dude, Where's My Car?_ with us. He was somewhat unimpressed, and we, of course, loved it again. This time I noticed that the guy with the ostriches ("Pierre") is played by [Brent Spiner](http://us.imdb.com/Name?Spiner,+Brent) (the guy who played Data on Star Trek).

And today, I created a new icon for [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/). Mozilla is the open-source backbone that Netscape is built on. I just installed the latest version on my computer, and I'm very happy with it. It's much more stable than the last version I tested. The only problem is that it comes with a really ugly icon. It's blue and gray and I guess it's supposed to be a gecko (the name of their rendering engine), but it's hard to tell. So I went to their website, where they have a great red and black logo of a dinosaur, and I created an icon based on that art. I submitted it to the webmaster at the Mozilla site, but I doubt I'll hear back from them. If you want the icon, you can download it [here](http://spaceninja.local/downloads/mozicon/mozilla.ico). (you might have to right click on the link and select "save as").
