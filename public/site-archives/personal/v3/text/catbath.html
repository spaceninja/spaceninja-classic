<font size=4><b>Cat Bathing As A Martial Art</b></font>
<br>By Dogbyte

<P>Some people say cats never have to be bathed.
they say cats lick themselves clean. they say cats have a special
enzyme of some sort in their saliva that works like new, improved Wisk -
dislodging the dirt where it hides and whisking it away.

<P>I've spent most of my life believing this
folklore. Like most blind believers, I've been able to discount all the
facts to the contrary, the kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage
and dirt smudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace.

<P>The times comes, however, when a man must face
reality: when he must look squarely in the face of massive public
sentiment to the contrary and announce: "This cat smells like a
port-a-potty on a hot day in Juarez."

<P>When that day arrives at your house, as it has in
mine, I have some advice you might consider as your place your feline
friend under your arm and head for the bathtub:

<P>-Know that although the cat has the advantage of
quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of
strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield.
Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase
him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four
feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the
sliding-glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple
shower curtaiin will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber
shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)

<P>-Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to
remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are
smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas
overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves,
an army helmet, a hockey face mask, and a long-sleeved flak jacket.

<P>-Prepare everything in advance. there is no time
to go out for a towel when you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket.
Draw the water. Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the
glass enclosure. Make sure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying
on your back in the water.

<P>-Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat
nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not
usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in
fashion as a rule. If he does notice your garb, calmly explain that you
are taking part in a product testing experiment for J.C. Penny.)

<P>-Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to
survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the
tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt
him with shampoo. You have begun the wildest 45 seconds of your life.

<P>Cats have no handles. Add the fact that he now has
soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold
on to him for more than two or three seconds at a time. When you have him,
however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like
crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby
rinsing himself off. (The national record for cats is three latherings, so
don't expect too much.)

<P>-Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers
always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are
worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In
fact, the drying is simple compared to what you have just been through.
That's because by now the cat is semipermanently affixed to your right
leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel
and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top
of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to
shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water
is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the
cat.

<P>In a few days the cat will relax enough to be
removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three
weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might
even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plastic
figurine.

<P>You will be tempted to assume he is angry.
This isn't usually the case. As a rule he is simply plotting ways to
get through your defenses and injure you for life the next time you decide to
give him a bath.

<P>But at least now he smells a lot better.
