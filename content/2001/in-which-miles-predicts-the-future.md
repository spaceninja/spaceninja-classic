You know, the sheer frustration of having George Bush Jr. as a president is mitigated only in being dwarfed by the knowledge that our economy is slowly and surely headed back into the toilet bowl of the 80s and thence into the sewer of the Great Depression, and that the fear which this generates will play right into the Republicans' time-old marketing tactics of fear and alienation, spiced with senseless rah-rah.

Then again, he didn't get the popular vote, so maybe we'll kick him out in ought four.

Then again, this is a populace that can't even figure out for itself why its kids are shooting up their schools.

Or is it?

I need to get out more.
