[![19 Week Ultrasound](/images/blog-photos/ultrasound2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/272906427/)

We had our 19-week ultrasound this morning, and as the nurse put it "You're having a girl, and she's got a mind of her own!" She was referring to the way it... no, _she_ (still getting used to that) kept wiggling around, refusing to hold still, or blocking the angles the nurse needed with various appendages. Apparently she's healthy and doing well, though we may need a followup ultrasound to check the last few angles they couldn't get today. We almost didn't get to find out the gender, because she was curled up in fetal position, with her feet down by her bottom, blocking the view of anything, but at the last minute she gave what the nurse called the "playboy centerfold" pose, and let us confirm that there's no penis. (They printed that one out, too, but Annie won't let me post it. I'll just have to save it for [Baby Album B](http://www.ironycentral.com/archives/babyvol/babyvol1.html).)

Annie swears that at one point she waved to us. That's not what I saw, though. The hand motion I saw was more like she was shooing us away to let her sleep longer, and pulling the covers up higher... just like her mom.
