I've been having a lot of fun playing with Opera (which I recently installed the latest version of), browsing in the "small screen" setting, which squeezes the page down into a 320 pixel wide ribbon, to accomodate palm pilots with 320x320 screens.

It's funny when you're using it on a regular computer, because it distorts things, leaves out images that it can't deal with, and shrinks fonts somewhat randomly.

The resulting pages are perfectly readable, but extra-amusing.

. . . however, this is \*all\* I've been doing with Opera, since no matter how I tweak the cookie settings, yahoo! mail won't let me log in, insisting my browser is refusing cookies. And that's just a damn lie.
