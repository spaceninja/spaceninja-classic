Whoo! It's been a busy busy week. Eric and Jill stayed with us for a few days early in the week so they could work out final details with their apartment and school. It was fun to see Gavin again, who is really really excited to move down here.  
  
They had to go home to finish packing, and that night Annie's mom showed up, and she's been staying with us for the weekend, and the night before last my parents came over, and we spent a couple hours putting together wedding invitations.  
  
I also watched a lot of movies this weekend. KT and I went to see _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_, which was about what I expected. They changed almost everything about the characters, made the story much more one-dimensional, but it was still fun and had some great visualizations (the Nautilus is amazing). Last night I saw _Chicago_ with Annie and her mom, which I didn't think I would like, but it was really good. Also, I watched the final episode of Gormenghast with KT (which was awful), and we rented _Being There_, and old Peter Sellers film, which was sort of like an earlier, better version of Forrest Gump.
