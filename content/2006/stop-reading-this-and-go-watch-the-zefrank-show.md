I was going to post a whole bunch of links and stuff that I've rounded up over the last few days, but as I sorted through them, one quickly rose to the top, and eventually I stopped caring about all the others. The only thing that I want to show other people right now is [The Show with Zefrank](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/).

It's been in the linkrolls on a bunch of the websites I read, so I had a couple copies of it in my bookmarks, and I only got around to looking at it tonight.

Basically, it's a daily short video from a guy named Zefrank (Is that his last name? First name? Nickname?). It's an incredibly fast-paced trip through his daily thoughts on the world and on the news, and his tagline is "Thinking, so you don't have to." The entire thing reminds me a LOT of [Urn](http://www.alt3t.net/blog/), only with ADD.

Anyways, stop wasting time reading this and go watch [that](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/)! Seriously, go now, I can't recommend this enough!
