I'm testing out a couple things with this new skin. One is the color scheme. I saw it in a screenshot that I really liked, so i decided to imitate it. I think it's very soothing, and looks pretty cool at the same time.  
  
The other thing is some more advanced CSS stylin's. I hacked around with the code that displays the journal entries and added some more CSS styles to it. The end result is that if you ignore CSS, everything should work just fine, but if you're interested in playing with it, you can achieve some neat effects, such as this design, without having to try to cram tables into your journal entries (if you view the source to this page, you'll see that except for a couple of tables to do some layout stuff at the top, the journal entries themselves are not in tables. All these borders and things are being done with DIV tags and CSS... and it's pretty easy).  
  
Tutorial coming soon, I promise. -----
