For the past several weeks, I've been having trouble sleeping. This varies from slight restlessness before I fall asleep to being completely unable to relax, even though I feel tired and my eyes are "sticky". Tonight, after heading to bed around 2am, I tossed and turned for about an hour, before I gave up and read a book for awhile. When that didn't work, I came out and watched some TV. When that didn't work, I decided to try to get some web developement done, but on a whim, I looked up [insomnia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia) on wikipedia.

I'm hardly the hypocondriac type who reads pages on diseases and convinces himself that he's sick. I'm pretty much the opposite, in fact. So I was expecting to find that insomnia is different (and more severe) than what I'm experiencing. I was right, but imagine my suprise when I read this on the list of types of insomnia:

> **Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb Movement (PLM)** - The symptoms of RLS and PLM are often described as a tingling and creeping sensation in the legs which creates a powerful urge to move them. The individual continually moves in bed in an attempt to relieve these unpleasant sensations, resulting in restlessness and consequently lack of sleep. Fortunately for sufferers of the condition, current treatments for this disorder are effective in over 90% of those treated.

Clicking over to the page about [Restless Leg Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restless_Leg_Syndrome), I was amazed at how well it described what I was experiencing. Just a couple days ago, I was trying to describe to Annie the strange ache in my legs, and how it's not a pain so much as an overwhelming desire to stretch my legs out. It's a really hard sensation to describe, and the page explains it as "an urge to move the legs and sometimes arms, which can be irresistible when severe; this is usually associated with an abnormal sensation such as a "creepy" or "crawly" feeling, a tickle, an ache, or a discomfort that may be very difficult to put into words."

Feel free to read the page, but to make a long story short, this is **exactly** what I've been experiencing my whole life, to some degree. Long car rides were horrific when I was a teenager, and I had to have enough room to stretch my legs out as far as I could - which we chalked up to "growing pains." It was the best way to describe it, even though there was no real pain, just an incredibly powerful urge to move. I remember nights when I was a teenager where I had my mom drive me over to the track so that I could just run some laps, just so that I could be moving. My mom has the same problem, and frequently spends nights sleeping in an armchair downstairs because her legs are restless.

Now, these symptoms have largely subsided, and the only real result is that I'm still a very restless person. I rarely sit still for longer than an hour, I tap my legs, and I toss and turn all night long. By now, I've accepted all of these as just part of who I am, and it's generally not a problem. But the past few weeks everything has gotten more severe, to the point where I'm typing this up at four in the morning.

I feel better knowing that this is a real problem, and that there are other people who go through this, and it's not just some weird family thing. Still, before I go to a doctor, there are some things I'm going to do. If I can avoid having to take a drug for this, I'm going to.

First of all, many of the tips for [RLS](http://www.rls.org/index.html) are the same as the tips for Insomnia in general. Use your bed for sleeping only and keep your bedroom dark and quiet. Drink warm milk or eat some turkey or peanut butter. Avoid heavy meals or drinks before bedtime. Cut the caffeine (and alcohol and cigarettes, but I don't smoke and don't drink often). Take a warm bath or a short walk. These are all good ideas, and I'll keep them in mind.

Secondly, there are some lifestyle suggestions, which neatly line up with things I already know I need to do, so this just gives me more motivation. I need to exercise every day for at least a half-hour. I need to make sure that dinnertime is at least three hours before bedtime. I need to avoid sugary drinks before bedtime, and certainly no caffeine. And I need to keep a regular schedule. I really need to start getting up at the same time every day, and going to bed at the same time, too. Getting on a schedule will help my body know when to expect to sleep, and when to be awake.

I'm going to work on all of these in the next several weeks, and if I'm still having trouble, I'll go see a doctor. If I'm careful, I should be able to get through this without having anything more severe than an iron suppliment vitamin.

Anyone else going through this?
