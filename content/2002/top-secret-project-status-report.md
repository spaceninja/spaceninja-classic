Top Secret Project Status Report: one more week.

We actually got the project "completed," but there were some last minute problems that were too much to deal with at 2am, so everyone went home. We had lots of fun, though, and the resources involved in this project have skyrocketed. Currently, it's taken two full nights, 5 minds working on it, seemingly endless hours of coding, and 2 computers. We'll be getting together again next Sunday to finally finish this thing and upload it for all to gaze upon in awe.
