I just finished working on [KT's blog](http://kt.spaceninja.com/) design. She sent me a mockup, and it took me pretty much forever to get around to doing it. I kept putting it off because it involved reworking her templates to my new standards, and then updating her CSS would be easier. Well, tonight I sat down and did it, and now it's done! If she needs any changes, I can easily make them in the CSS without having to tweak lots of other stuff in her templates.

**edit:** Wow. IE really butchers the colors of those bevels. I'll have to see if I can fix that somehow.

**edit:** Heh - this is post 1337.
