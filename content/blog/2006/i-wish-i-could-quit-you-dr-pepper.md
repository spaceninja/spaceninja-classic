Since starting my new job, I've been slowly putting on weight. I'm not thrilled with this, since I was carrying more than my fair share to begin with. While I'm still looking for an exercise solution that I'll be able to stick with in the long run, I've set my focus on other places in my life where I can make some improvements.

I drink too much soda. Out of everything I consume, soda is probably the worst thing for me. Empty calories, sugar water, etc. Getting a handle on this would also be a huge help.

A year or two ago, I came to a similar realization that I was drink too much soda. The resolution at the time was to quit keeping soda in the house, since that's where I was drinking most of it. That worked really well. The problem now is that there's soda in the fridge at work, and I've been having a can of Coke almost every day, as well as having soda almost every day with lunch.

I'm a firm believer in setting realistic goals. If I said that I wanted to quit drinking soda entirely, it wouldn't happen. We would go on a car trip, or go out to dinner, or to a movie, and I would have a soda, and end up giving up. But the problem is not the occasional soda when I'm out - the problem is the regular soda as part of my routine.

So starting last week, I've quit drinking soda entirely while I'm at work. This means no soda with lunch and no soda in the afternoon. It's especially hard when it's really hot in the office and I can hear other people cracking open cold sodas, but luckily, we have a really good water cooler that gives ice cold water, so I've been drinking that whenever I get a craving. Wish me luck!
