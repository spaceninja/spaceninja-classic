Man, I'm getting really sick of this. The comment spam is getting out of hand, so I've been forced to escalate my defenses. At first, I could just delete the spams as they came in. They they became too numerous to handle, so I started blacklisting IP addresses. Then the spammers started randomizing their IPs, so I set up MT-Blacklist, and started blacklisting URLs. Well, even that's not working, because they just add new URLs.

My latest technique? I've removed the URL and Email fields from the comments form. I'm hoping that if they can't link to their websites, they won't waste their time spamming my site.

Of course, I can't stop them from putting a URL into the comment itself, so the last logical step here will be to turn off auto-linking, which is a feature I like.

If even that doesn't stop them, then I'm stuck. I may be forced at that point to upgrade to MT3 for the superior spam-blocking features. :(
