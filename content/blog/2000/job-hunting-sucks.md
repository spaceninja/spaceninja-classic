Yarrr... I'm feeling better! Still kinda sniffly and coughy, but definitely better. We're cleaning house today, which always feels kinda symbolic. You let the house get into terrible shape, because you feel too bad to clean, so then when you get over it, you need to clean, but it's sorta ritualistic, representing the cleansing of the self and something something something.

Posted a new wallpaper to the desktop section.

Tomorrow I'm going job hunting. I really hate looking for jobs, especially when there aren't any available. No one in town is hiring, and so tomorrow I'm going to the grocery stores to see if they need a checker. Arrrgh. I really don't want to work grocery again. Admittedly, it's better than no job at all, but not by much. Oh well. Maybe I'll luck out and they'll have some full-time work available and I can at least make a lot of money doing a job I hate.

I want a webcam.

I'm really pleased with the site updates I've been making lately. Steve helped me improve [Obey Fojar](https://archives.spaceninja.com/obey/v2/) by adding the power of FCS to it. Now each image has it's own comments journal that people can add to. Very cool.

I've also been experimenting with some new art styles that I've seen online and been very impressed with. Perhaps they will find their way into some new Y5 material. That site really needs updating.
