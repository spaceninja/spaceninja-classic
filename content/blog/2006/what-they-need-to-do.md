> "What they need to do is to get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this shit." â€” President George W. Bush

**Update:** There has been a LOT of commentary about this quote, largely consisting of people saying "Who cares in the president swore?" Jon Stewart put it well when he said "I'm just glad he was on target." But no one has put it better than [zefrank](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/071906.html), who remarks that "While Bush has been made fun of in the past for his less than adept use of language, in this case, the word 'shit' is pretty much dead-on."
