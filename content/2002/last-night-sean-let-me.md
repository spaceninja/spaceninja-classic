Last night Sean let me and Zach come up to the theatre for the test screening of _Resident Evil_. I was expecting a movie that was low on plot, high on action, and lots and lots of zombies.  
  
It did not disappoint. The movie had everything you would expect from a zombie-fest, short of the zombie mumbling "BRAINS..." They never quite resorted to cheap scare tactics and mostly just did things that really made you squirm. It was great fun to watch.  
  
We also got to watch _Ice Age_, which was corny, but mostly good. The sabre-toothed tiger (voiced by dennis leary, I think) was kind of a weak character, but they had a really good dynamic going between the mammoth (Ray Romano) and the sloth (John Leguizamo, I believe). But as [Sean](http://nyarlo.net/) said, the squirrel-rat thing stole the show. He was easily the funniest and best thing in it, and the whole movie is worth watching (if not paying for) just to see the final scene he does.
