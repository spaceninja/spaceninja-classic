it is 1:30am and i've just gotten home from the last of my band's regular sunday shows. what a great experience, and what great fun. polka solos, playing old-time fiddle, playing a guitar accompany to another old-time fiddler — and this isn't even what i was getting paid to do!

we had a month of sundays as a regular act at the moon and sixpence, and though there's talk of setting us up with a permanent wednesday gig, thus far it's just talk. still..we had a blast, and got a lot of positive feedback every week. we've tricked at least a few people into thinking we sound all right (ah, the thieving, deceptive life of a gypsy..)!

pros:
\- locking in and playing well and discovering what we sound like when we actually do play well
\- earning a bit of cash doing something i enjoy
\- getting to flirt with the cute waitress
\- (getting to leave after that ;) )
\- free food and drinks

cons:
\- having to deal with stefana's extreme mood swings. if ever there was, is, or shall be a fickle woman in my life, stefana has raised the bar substantially.
\- not a permanent gig \*sad face\*

i think i will miss most of all starting each week with a plate of fish and chips on the house.

(oh! by the way.. in a week or two, i'm going to play a solo at a regional polka jam..i'll post more details when i get them.)
