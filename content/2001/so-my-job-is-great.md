So my job is great. I'm working with Steve, doing stuff I love. The boss has already upped my hours twice, and sounds confident that the two salespeople he's hiring will enable him to bring me on full-time. The DSL's due in a little more than a week, and Annie's getting food stamps tomorrow, so we'll be able to afford food! Life is starting to pick up for me.

About the only thing that isn't working out perfectly is the fact that I'm online a good deal more often now that I'm working, which means that my family and I come into conflict over the phone line. It's all been civilized so far, but just the same, I'm glad the DSL will be here soon.

Also, I relocated my computer. It's funny, but just moving it to a different room in the house has totally increased my motivation to work on it. Maybe there's something to this Feng Shui stuff.

Unfortunately, with my upturn in luck, Annie's seems to be in a slump. Her sprained ankle got worse today, though how much of that is due to her forgetting to take her medicine isn't clear. The doctor gave her one more week of light duty, which means more office work. Hopefully her leg will heal up quickly and she'll be able to get back to doing the fun stuff.
