While Miles and I are certainly grateful for the attention that our comics get by virtue of being connected in some way to [Pokey](http://www.yellow5.com/pokey/), it's always nice when our comics receive some recognition of their own.

Recently, all three of us were contacted by a Brazilian Pokey fan, who wanted to write an article about webcomics for a magazine he works at. He interviewed all three of us, and last month the article came out. Along with the three of us, he spoke to the guy who writes Diesel Sweeties and Penny Arcade, and the article itself was fairly well balanced, featuring a quote from each comic's author. The cool part (for Miles and I) was that when the art director chose the images to go along with the article, he included one image from Penny Arcade, 5 images from Iso, and 6 panels from [Hammerspace](https://archives.spaceninja.com/hammerspace/v2/). The magazine is already out, so Miles and I are kind of hoping that we'll somehow develop a large fan base in Brazil. As soon as we get permission, I'll post the translated article, and scans of the magazine pages.

[Isometric](http://isometric.sixsided.org/) managed to score a rather large bit of attention recently, as well, when [Scott McCloud](http://www.scottmccloud.com/) linked to Iso off the [front page of his site](/images/miles/scott_mccloud.png)! (for those of you who don't know, Scott McCloud wrote what is essentially the definitive reference book on the theories behind comic books, talking about why they work, and what potential they hold as an art form. He also is a large supporter of the webcomics "movement," so naturally, his website gets quite a bit of traffic, and a link on the front page is no small thing).

So, in summary, hooray for us!
