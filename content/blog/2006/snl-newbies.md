> **Andy Samberg:** You're talking about a gun, right?
>
> **Bill:** Yes. I come to work with a gun.
>
> **Andy:** Under your belt?

> **Kristen Wiig:** You can't print that.

> **Bill:** I mean, I've got a license for it. I use it for an intimidation tool. It's not loaded. "Oh really? You don't like that sketch?"
>
> **Andy:** "Well, I've got a piece underneath my belt."
>
> **Bill:** I'm just putting my guns on the table, I'm just saying.
>
> **Kristen:** We're all required to bring some sort of weapon.
