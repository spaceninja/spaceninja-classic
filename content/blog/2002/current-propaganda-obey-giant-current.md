**current propaganda:** _obey giant_

Ahhhh, I had a great Thanksgiving! Sean, Annie and I went up to her parents house for a long weekend of food and LAN gaming. We had a lot of fun hanging out with everyone, and I ate way too much. Everyone in Annie's family brought some food, so of course we ended up with 2 bowls of mashed potatoes and one boat of gravy for 23 people. On the other hand, there were about 10 pies, so no one was complaining.

We did quite a lot of gaming, too, which was great. We played some Quake III, some team-based Castle Wolfenstein, some Age of Mythology, and I think a little to everyone's suprise, quite a lot of Freedom Force! It's a game based on 1950's style Jack Kirby superheros, which is kind of annoying. The genius of the game comes into how amazingly customizable it is for multiplayer. You can make a hero with just about any combination of powers you want, though you may still find yourself coming back to the old favorite of just throwing police cars at one another.

Now that we're back in town, I'm just trying to get back into my standard routine. I almost missed a conference call with a client this morning at work that I completely forgot about, which turned out to be a good thing, because it forced me to snap out of it, and get back into "work mode." Still, it's a transition I hate making, so the idea of going up to Annie's parents again in a few weeks and working from there for the week before Christmas is sounding more and more appealing.
