My new video card arrived yesterday, and I had the fun of discovering that it doesn't work. The manufacturer's website (which is horrible) is confusing and full of typos, which isn't exactly inspiring me with confidence. Nor is the fact that the only phone number they list is in Taiwan, so I have to wait for the email tech support to write me back. I hate email tech support, because it always takes three times as long while the technicians suggest you try all the normal things like installing drivers and stuff. My mac has made me even more intolerant of hardware that doesn't just work out of the box.
