I've been seeing [more and more](http://www.walkering.com/walkerings/2006/07/spammed_out.html) of [the blogs](http://www.alt3t.net/blog/reply.asp?pid=224) I read lately complaining about [comment spam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_spam) attacks. [Having](/?s=spam) [had](/blog/2005/hacked/) [a](/blog/2005/spam-attack/) [bit](/blog/2005/thoughts-on-wordpress/) [of](/blog/2004/migrating-to-wordpress-i/) [experience](/blog/2004/mt-spam-comments-iv/) [with](/blog/2004/mt-spam-comments-iii/) [this](/blog/2004/mt-spam-comments-ii/) [myself](/blog/2004/mt-spam-comments-i/), [I](/blog/2003/more-spam-than-you-can-shake-a-stick-at/) [can](/blog/2003/if-youre-interested-at-all/) [sympathize](/blog/2002/well-it-finally-happened-i/).

The single best thing I can recommend is to get [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) running on your blog. Since installing it several months ago, I have had zero comment spams. I check my filtered comments pretty regularly, and as far as I can tell, it's never prevented a real user from commenting, or gotten any false positives. Comment spam has simply stopped being a factor in my life, and it's nice. Akismet was originally written for WordPress in PHP, but versions have been released for just about everything, including Movable Type and even other platforms and libraries, like Ruby and Perl.

Sadly, the two examples I linked to won't be able to use this, because Urn rolled his own blog in .NET, and Walkerings is hosted on TypePad (which doesn't allow plugins, as far as I know).
