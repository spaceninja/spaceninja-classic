**Scott:** I'd like to order the OPPLI TV bench, please.  
**IKEA:** Alright, that's $99 plus $230 shipping, which brings your total to $330...  
**Scott:** WHAT? Why is it that high?  
**IKEA:** It has to ship from New Jersey via freight. Would you like to order any additional items to lower the shipping cost?  
**Scott:** No, thanks, I'll pass.  
  
I don't care how cool the IKEA stuff is. It's not worth paying twice the cost of the item to get it shipped. I mean, when she said it was $230 shipping, I thought it was being shipped from Sweden or something. Good lord...
