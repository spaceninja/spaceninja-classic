There is a TV commercial for Excedrin Migrane medicine which bothers me. A woman is speaking about the wonders of this miracle drug, and I swear, she actually says this: "I saw on a website that Excedrin blah blah works wonders blah blah..."

Oh yeah. Not "clinical studies have shown that..." or "four out of five doctors prefer..." or even "I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV." Nope. "_I saw on a website that..._"

I love that she doesn't even qualify what kind of website. I bet it was some GeoCities fan page. "NUdE PiX of DReW BaRRyMoRe! And Excedrin works wonders!"

Also, there is a new show on Comedy Central called Sports Night, which is really really cool. It's funny and I'm really enjoying it, but I have to say that Comedy Central does one thing that bugs me. They don't play the episodes in order. They jump all over the place. Each week, they play two episodes in a row. But the next week, the two episodes might be four episodes in the future, or six episodes back. It's like a weird trip through time. From the frame of reference of the first episode I saw, I've been to the future, into the past, back to the present, to the future, to the far past, back to the future! It's very confusing.
