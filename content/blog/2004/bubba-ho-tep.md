Last night, Sean and Annie and I went to go see what is probably one of the greatest B-movies ever made: _Bubba-Ho-Tep_.

Brutal Plot Summary: Living in the same rest home, Elvis and JFK team up to fight a reincarnated mummy.

But just in case that's not odd enough for you, here are some character details:

Elvis is actually Elvis. He traded places with an Elvis impersonator to escape the trappings of fame and live a normal life, but the impersonator died, and now no one beleives that he is really himself.

JFK is an elderly black man, and the only one who believes that Elvis is who he says he is. When Elvis tries to point out that JFK was a white man, he replies "They died me this color! That's how clever they are!"

The Mummy wears cowboy boots and a cowboy hat for no appearent reason, except that they are in Texas.

Memorable Quote: "The keywords for tonight are Caution and Flammability."

If you like cheesy movies, or if you like Bruce Campbell, go see this right away!
