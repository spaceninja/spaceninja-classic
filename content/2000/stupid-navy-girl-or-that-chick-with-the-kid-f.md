\-or- That Chick With The Kid

Following my breakup with Army Girl, I went something like a year without seeing anyone. In the meantime, I (finally) moved out of my parent's place and moved into an apartment with an old friend on campus.

I remember being pathetically lonely at this time, and being excited when my roommate and I joined the Orientation Program. I was excited because there were lots of attractive women in there, and I hoped I would end up dating one of them. Sure enough, I met a woman really quickly. We talked at bit in class, but didn't hook up until the retreat for Orientation.

The retreat took us all to the beach for a weekend. Guys and Girls were separated into different rooms, but the day ended pretty early and there was plenty of time left to socialize before everyone crashed in their respective rooms.

She and I hit it off really well. A bunch of us all started playing truth or dare one night, and she and I were practically making out during the game.

Following the retreat, we started dating, but it was supposed to be very secretive (yeah, right). She was really concerned that people in Orientation would figure out we were dating. I didn't care as much, but I could respect that she was worried so we tried to be inconspicuous. We sat apart in class and barely spoke, though I remember one day where during the class break she took me to her office on campus and we made out for a few minutes... :)

She lived across the river, maybe a 15 minute car ride away. She didn't like the fact that I couldn't drive and kept trying to talk me into taking the bus to her house, which I was really opposed to for some reason I don't remember now.

Here's the strange thing. I knew all this time that she had a kid. She had been in the Navy, and apparently slept around as much as she wanted (which was quite a bit). She was always protected when she did this, but when her and another guy got serious, somehow she got pregnant. They threw her out of the Navy and the guy dumped her.

So now she had a three year old kid, who was really cool, but that's kind of an odd situation. She was only a few years older than me, but at the same time, she was a parent!

I did my best to cope with this, but it's a really strange thing when she doesn't put the kid to bed until midnight, and then he walks into the room while we're having sex.

The kid thing was tough to roll with, but I was getting used to it. What was hard was the fact that she obviously was more into the kid than me. This is understandable, and I wouldn't have wanted her to be more into me than the kid, but I did feel neglected a lot of the time. The hardest thing was that she was such a different person than me when she was around her kid. When we were alone, we got along wonderfully, but when the kid was around, she was mommy and everything was different.

But despite all that, there was one thing that kept us trying. The sex was fucking incredible. I'm not exaggerating. This is the best sex I've had. She knew what she wanted, she knew what I wanted, she knew how to keep us both happy... oh man. I tried things I'd never tried before, and I don't think I'm lying when I say that most everything good that I know about sex I learned from her.

As time passed, I think she started realizing that she didn't like me when she was in mommy mode, which was more and more often, since we were mostly hanging out at her house. One day, we had a huge fight about something really stupid and she ended up driving me home, telling me about all the stuff she didn't like about me on the way. By the time I got home, I was so pissed at her that I didn't care about the sex, I just wanted away from this psycho bitch.

I still feel that way. We only dated for a couple months, but I think I'm better off without her. I miss the sex, but that's not the most important thing in a relationship, even though it can feel that way sometimes.

I found out recently that she ended up marrying the guy who got her pregnant and they're moving somewhere better for the kid, and she's dropped out of school. I can't help feeling that she doesn't really want to be with the guy, but is just doing it because she wants the kid to know his dad.
