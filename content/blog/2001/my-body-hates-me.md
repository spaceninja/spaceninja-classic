Feb.- treated for depression June- ear drum surgery Oct.- sprain ankle Nov.- fillings in teeth/raging cold Jan.- have wisdom teeth removed

not to mention all the back & neck pain and cramps I have every month!

mom can stop worrying about me getting pregnant before I finish college, my body won't let me! I can barely pick up babies let alone have one! it's so frustrating to finally want my body and mind to be in concert with one another and then for my body to back out on the deal and leave my mind out in the cold.

I take way too many drugs and they're not even the fun kind...I can't afford to drink and even if I could, that has it's own set of problems as I'm allergic to brewers yeast.

I know, I know..."don't dwell on the negative annie, if you change your attitude you'll get better...blah blah blah..."

yeah well screw you! I'll cheer up when I'm damn well good and ready! I'm doing my best not to sink into heavy depression now that things aren't going the way I thought they would, and some days are worse than others. As anyone who lives with pain knows, somedays you can grin and bear it and try to navigate through the day and other days you find yourself wallowing in the misery of it all and have a hard time getting out of that. I refuse to pretend that I'm taking this well all the time and that I should just smile and keep my complaints quiet. I'm not going to hide and be quiet if I'm in pain dammit.

can't I just be unpleasant now and then without feeling guilty for it? I can't be in a good mood all the time 'cause that'd be faking it. someone likes to say to me, "I don't care if you're in a bad mood, I just don't think you should take it out on me." What the fuck is that? you're here! who else am I supposed to express my bad mood to? so I'm "allowed" to be unpleasant as long as you don't have to hear it? it's not even at you! what the hell do you think being close to someone is all about? only expressing the results of a good day? fuuucckkk...

I'm so sick of having to apologize for my rants. I'm going to be unhappy sometimes. not that I don't want to be happy, it's just a little more infrequent nowadays...I have a couple major happy things going on in my life, but I have overhanging bad clouds too. some days it's very hard to focus on the happy things when this big fucking cloud is blocking your vision. you can't always fly around it....

I don't know where I fit anymore, except at my house, but I have to leave the house sometime.

It can't rain all the time... :)
