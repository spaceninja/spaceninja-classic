so.. yesterday morning stephanie called me up at 5:30 in the AM, awakening me from a prophetic dream.

in my subconscious dreaming mind, i coined a new phrase.. this phrase means, to do something without your pants on. the phrase is: chicago-style

now, to clarify, you can and probably should have underwear on if you're doing something chicago-style, but pants are definitely off and maybe folded up and hung over the back of a chair.

in my dream, my usage was, "yeah, you should come over tonight. we're just hanging out chicago-style." clearly understood. other possible usages: working from home these days, i frequently work chicago-style. in the summertime, i often sleep chicago-style. playing in the ocean, you gotta go chicago-style.
