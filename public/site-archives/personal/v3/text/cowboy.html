<font size=4><b>The Cowboy Joke</b></font>
<br>An old cowboy dressed to kill with cowboy shirt, hat, jeans, spurs and chaps went to a bar and ordered a drink.  As he sat there sipping his whiskey, a young lady sat down next to him. After she ordered her drink she turned to the cowboy and asked him, "Are you a real cowboy?" To which he replied, "Well, I have spent my whole life on the ranch herding cows, breaking horses, mending fences, I guess I am." After a short while he asked her what she was. She replied, "I've never been on a ranch so I'm not a cowboy, but I am a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. As soon as I get up in the morning I think of women, when I eat, shower, watch TV, everything seems to make me think of women." A short while later she left and the cowboy ordered another drink.

<P>A couple sat down next to him and asked, "Are you a real cowboy?"  To which he replied, "I always thought I was, but I just found out that I'm a lesbian."
