<b>The Devil Joined A Quake Server</b>
<i>Lyrics by Scott Vandehey.
Sing to the tune of "The Devil Went Down To Georgia."</i>

The devil joined a Quake server,
He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bind
'Cause he was way behind
And he was willin' to make a deal.

When he came upon this young man playing
In a LAN game and playin' it hot,
The devil jumped up
On a wheeley chair and said
"Boy, let me tell ya what!"

"I bet you didn't know it,
But I'm a network gamer too,
And if you care to take a dare,
I'll make a bet with you."

"Now you play a pretty good shooter boy,
But give the devil his due
I'll bet an X-box of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you!"

The boy said "My name's Miles,
And it might be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best that's ever been!"

Miles set up your key-bindings
And settle in your seat,
Hell's broke loose on the network
And the devil looks elite.
And if you win you get this shiny console made of gold
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul!

The devil booted up his box and he said,
"I'll host this show."
And fire flew from his router
in the monitor's red glow.

As he slid his mouse across its pad,
It made an evil hiss
He called his demons to the game
From deep in the abyss

While the game was going Miles said,
"Well, you're pretty good old son!
But sit back in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done!"

Fire those chain guns, run boys run
Playing on the server named the Rising Sun
Circle strafe the bad guys, duck real low
Look at that rocket jump, go, man, go!

The devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat,
And he laid that golden x-box
On the ground at Miles' feet.

Miles said "Devil, just come on back
If you ever wanna try again,
I owned you once,
You son-of-a-bitch
And you know I'll do it again!"

He played:
Fire those chain guns, run boys run
Playing on a server named the Rising Sun
Circle strafe the bad guys, duck real low
Look at that rocket jump, go, man, go!
