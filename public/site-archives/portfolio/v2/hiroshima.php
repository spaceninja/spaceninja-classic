<p>For my Graphic Design II class at Portland State University, we were asked to produce a poster and postcard set for a fictional type exhibition. Our poster/postcard set was to showcase a single font with related imagery. I chose a font called Hiroshima, which resembles Japanese characters, and backed it up with a heavily modified and cleaned painting of giant robots from Japan.</p>
