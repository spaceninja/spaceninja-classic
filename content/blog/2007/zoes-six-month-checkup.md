We took Zoe in for her six-month checkup today. She weighs just shy of 16 pounds, and is 27½ inches long — which means she grew **four inches** in the last month! She also got her first vaccination, which she didn't enjoy. Oddly, I think she hated having her temperature taken more, because the nurse had to hold her arm down over the armpit thermometer, and Zoe hates being restrained.

**Update:** Well, I guess we were a bit over-enthusiastic. Annie double-checked when she got home and found out that it's been two months since the last doctor visit, not one, which means she grew four inches (still pretty good!) and gained about 2½ pounds in the last two months.
