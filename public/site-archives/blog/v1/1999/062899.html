<BR>Hmm. Well... I could write about all the stuff that has happened lately, but that seems like a lot to do, so instead I'm going to tell you about this kickass website Ryan sent me. It's at <A HREF="http://www.andrethegiant.com/">www.andrethegiant.com</A>, or if you prefer, <A HREF="http://www.obeygiant.com/">www.obeygiant.com.</A> They both go to the same place. This website, apart from hosting some awesome designs (very communist propoganda poster style) has some interesting ideas. They (He/She/It?) posted posters and stickers all over New York with Andre The Giant's face on them, and the words "Giant Has A Posse." The idea is that this is a completely meaningless phrase and that you could learn a lot by how people react to finding this in front of them (I recently did a similar project in Graphic Design class, which may be why I'm interested in this). Their manifesto is great, as is their poster gallery. They sell all their posters, and if anyone is ever looking for a good gift for me, that's the way to go. I would love to have most of the posters they've done. I've posted a few examples down below.

<P>You may have heard that I've moved. I just got all moved in with Annie at Goose Hollow. Things are going great right now. Annie's a little restless because she's got nowhere to go, and I'm at work all the time, but hopefully she'll get a job soon, and that'll take care of that. It'd be easier if we had TV reception, but with no money for cable, and no antenna on the TV (yes, I know I can make on with wire, but I don't have any wire, either)... you've be surprised how bad the reception is inside a concrete box. I'm hoping to get my dad to loan me his digital camera so that I can post some photos of what our place looks like.

<P>Since you're reading this, you've noticed that I've moved servers. That went fairly smoothly, except for the send-mail bug that Steve's trying to solve that prevents me from getting email at the spaceninja address. Hopefully that will be solved soon and all my woes will be gone! I'm pleased with the new site designs, and I've got a few coming. I'm going to get a great design up for the portfolio, and redesign the desktop themes page.

<P>It's kinda frustrating because all at once, everything in my life is being shared. I can't just leave things as I want them because they impact other people. The PDXmart project I'm working on with Miles and Steve and Dennis is behind, due entirely to me, so people are kinda upset (rightly so), Annie and I are discovering the new stresses of sharing a living space, and Steve is upset with me because I can't pay him. It's frustrating because I just don't have the money. It's not there. I can't borrow anymore from my parents because they just spend a bunch of money on me when I moved, I can't borrow from Annie's parents because they're in a tight spot, I'm already paying $800 in bills on a $500 paycheck and Annie's unemployed. I know it'll all be good in a couple of months, but that doesn't help when everyone's demanding their share of the non-existant money now. Oh well. Things will work out. I get paid on Wednesday, and Annie's hoping to get a call-back on a job-interview real soon.
