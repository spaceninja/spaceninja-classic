> "Once again \[Bush\] chastised critics, saying 'some are condemning a plan before it's even had a chance to work.' By then, of course, you're not really condemning a plan anymore, you're condemning a reality. No, the correct time to condemn a plan is when it's being made. That's what planning is." \-- Ze Frank, [discussing President Bush's controversial plan](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/01/012607.html) to increase troop levels in Iraq.
