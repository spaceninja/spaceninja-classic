Steve got the photos from our beach trip last weekend posted, and I thought I'd share a few of them here. Of special note, for those of you unfortunate souls who have never experienced the pure joy that is the Tillamook Cheese Factory, I even had Steve take some photos of that. Appropriately enough, all the photos of the factory are washed out in the same orange shade as delicious Tillamook Medium Cheddar. Enjoy!

        Here's Annie and I in the car on the way to the beach. I'm wearing my
        crummy cafepress
        <a href="http://spaceninja.com/">spaceninja</a> shirt. Oddly enough,
        this is one of the better photos taken of Annie and I in the last couple
        years.

        Here's Steph driving the car. She had just finished singing a very
        emotional rendition of "Don't Cry For Me, Argentina" which is why she
        looks so sad. Well, okay, I made that up. It was Steve who was singing.

        Despite what the thumbnail shows, this photo is of a giant
        <a href="http://www.yellow5.com/pokey/">Pokey</a> that Steve drew in the
        sand. I cropped it to the people he included in the photo for scale
        because the Pokey was invisible and it looked like a photo of sand when
        I made the original thumbnail.

        Here's a photo of (from left to right) Annie, myself, and Miles standing
        in the Pacific Ocean. The water is freezing, and full of little tiny
        insects that bit my ankles and dead jellyfish. I'm not entirely sure
        what Miles is doing here, possibly illustrating the proper kung-fu
        stance for standing ankle deep in the ocean while fending off an
        attacker and his girlfriend.

        the sand. This pic reminds me of the photos authors have of themselves
        on the book jacket. Someday, this will be Miles' book jacket photo.

        Another photo of pokey. It makes it look like I drew it, but I didn't.
        I'm standing in front of it because Steve wanted a person for scale. I
        thought about drawing a
        <a href="https://archives.spaceninja.com/hammerspace/v2/">hammerspace</a> character, but
        decided that the different pixels would just look like a bunch of
        squares without color.

        Most of the people seemed to operating various portions of the assembly
        line that packaged the cheese, but this woman was just making a large
        stack of cheese. I like to think that she was building a fort.

And that concludes our fabulous trip to the beach! If you want to see more photos from the trip, Steve has them all saved in his [photo archive](http://fojar.com/~steve/pics/), and you can see them [here](http://fojar.com/~steve/pics/us/oregon-summer-2002/).
