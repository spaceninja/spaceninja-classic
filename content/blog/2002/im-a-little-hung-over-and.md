I'm a little hung-over, and I've got a lot of work to do today (both actual job work, and cleaning up the house work), but I feel kind of bad, because I didn't post about anything other than our drunken exploits last night.

Everyone contributed some food to our dinner, and we had a pretty good feast! (speaking of which, if anyone's in the neighborhood and wants some leftovers for lunch, feel free to come by). KT's stuffing was delicious, Zima's mashed potatoes were great, and the KFC was not half-bad, either. Zima's tofurkey was really funny. It came in a box, and looked like a big oval lump of grey Jell-O. It also came with a "wishbone" made of tofurkey-jerky, and some drumsticks. I forget what the drumsticks were made of, but they were cookie-cutter pieces of tofurkey, a little darker than the main "bird". I don't like tofu, but everyone else said it turned out pretty tasty. We also had a lot of pie, with the two pumpkin pies, and Zach's tasty pecan pies!

After dinner, we all piled into the living room to watch Fight Club, which was great. I hadn't watched it in awhile, and it was Eric and Zima's first time.

Anyways, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who came over last night, I had a great time, and I hope you all did, too!
