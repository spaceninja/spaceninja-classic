Lots of crazy stuff going on lately. The [Myst 3 themes](/downloads/myst3/) contract got approved, and this weekend I was putting the finishing touches on the themes. Just a couple more tiny touches, and they'll be complete! I'll post screenshots for people to see when they're done.

Obviously, (to anyone who visits the site frequently), the server was down for awhile recently. I got a panicked ICQ message from Steve asking if I could pitch in for a new motherboard. To our relief, we found out the next night that the server wasn't dead at all, just the ISP had switched his IP number without telling him. So a couple days later, things were fine.

As for Studio Fojar, things are going well. The three of us are still excited about the idea, which is more than I can say about most of our ideas. I promise I'll put up a big post about here soon, and get the site done up properly soon.

Oh, and KT's christmas gift got here today. Once again, KT has triumphed in the gift department. She consistently finds these amazingly cool gifts that make me feel pathetic for what I got her. Anyways, I opened the package to find a large velvet box, which contained what appears to be a silver-plated mouse with my initials engraved on it. It's hilarious. I'll get a photo of it up somehow.
