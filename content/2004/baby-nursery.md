Advance warning to parents: this post is not about a baby nursery for Annie and I, so you can stop hyperventilating right now. All things in good time. In the meantime, enjoy this humorous post from a man who is remodeling a room for their coming baby's nursery.

> If I were left to my own devices, the [nursery](http://www.blurbomat.com/archives/2003/11/09/an_orgasm_of_shit.html "Blurbomat | An Orgasm of Shit") would consist of an iPod (40 gb) and a G5 (dual 2 Ghz) box. The baby would fit right into the G5 box and be ready to code PHP within three months after listening to subliminal coding lessons ripped and played back on the iPod.

You may have noticed I've been posting more frequently. Mostly that's because I found [the bloggies](http://www.bloggies.com/) site and followed the links to discover that almost every weblog they link to is quality reading with wonderful bits of humor tucked in. Someday I'll get back to posting real content, but right now, I'm recycling.

Oh, and I posted everyone's user icons on the [about page](/about/). If anyone hates their icon, they are welcome to email me a new headshot and I will use that instead.
