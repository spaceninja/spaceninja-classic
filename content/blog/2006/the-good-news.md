There has been a lot going on lately that I've been holding off from posting about until it was finalized, but I'm pleased to say that over the last week, two big things came together to the point that I can share them here.

First of all, [Pop Art](http://www.popart.com/), the company that I've been temping with for the last couple of months has decided to hire me! Some of the details are still being ironed out, but I can tell you that I'll be working in a production capacity, and doing more and more CSS work as time goes on, which is exactly what I was looking for. I'm being paid hourly, instead of being salaried (which has good points and bad points), but I get excellent benefits and room to grow in the field I want to work in. Also, the people are great, and the environment is laid back, which suits me perfectly... and after my last job is almost more important to me than what I'm doing or being paid.

The second bit of good news is now that I'm stable and we have dependable income, Annie and I started looking for a better place to live again. We've decided to delay the house hunt for a few years until our credit has settled a bit, and we can build up a nest egg for a deposit. In the meantime, we started looking for a nice house to rent.

It quickly became appearent that the kinds of places we were looking for were a bit outside our comfort zone in terms of rent, but if we went up to the next rent bracket, suddenly we were finding lots of really nice little three-bedroom houses. So we asked Sean if he was interested in living with us, and he agreed to come look at some places with us.

Astonishingly, the first day we were out looking, after seeing a few so-so places, we found the perfect place to get with Sean. It's 3 bedroom, 2.5 baths, full living/dining room, full finished basement, all new appliances. It looks great, and it fit our needs perfectly. There were some other people looking at it, but long story short, a few days later, we were meeting with the landlords to sign the initial paperwork, and this weekend we'll be meeting with them again to sign the final paperwork and cut them a check for the first month's rent.

Sean has already [posted some photos on his blog](http://nyarlo.net/boggle/2006/01/31/house/), and this weekend, I'll be taking some photos myself, as well as a video walkthrough, which I'll post here.

Today is my first day at the new job, and we're moving into the new place in three weeks!
