Zoe has been sick off and on for about two weeks now. It started with an ear infection, which got bad enough that her doctor put her on antibiotics. Then she got a bit of a cold, threw up a couple of times, and then diarrhea for about a week. Plus she's been teething.

Yesterday, I stayed home sick with some sort of intestinal bug. It was unpleasant but not horrible, and I honestly didn't think it was connected. I figured I ate something that didn't agree with me, but then I found out that:

- Zoe's friend Maia was puking so much she's at the hospital right now.
- My nephew Milo is sick.
- My brother-in-law David is sick.
- My mother-in-law is sick.
- My mom is sick.
- Three of my coworkers are sick.
- Annie is sick
- Annie's uncle Darby is sick.

Now, I'm not a medical professional, but it sounds to me like we're the incubators for some advanced new form of the Black Death. If you've been in contact with us anytime in the last three years, I would advise you to go home and take a hydrogen peroxide bath.

**Edit, the next day:** Added my mother-in-law to the list. _It's spreading._

**Edit, three days later:** Added Annie and Darby to the list. Will it ever stop?
