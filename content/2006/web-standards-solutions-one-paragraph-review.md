[![Web Standards Solutions by Dan Cedarholm](/images/298401113_1eabc7919e_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298401113/)Dan Cedarholm has written a very nice book introducing the reader to the concept of web standards. Unlike Zeldman's book, which is nearly all theory, this book is heavily focused on markup techniques, with some basic introduction to CSS. Each chapter presents a variety of scenarios, such as how to mark up a grocery list. Several techniques are discussed, and the advantages or disadvantages of each are explained. If you've been in the web standards game for awhile, there's nothing new in here, but if you're just getting started, this can be a helpful guide to understanding the semantics of markup. (_If this book were a college course, it would be 100 level._)
