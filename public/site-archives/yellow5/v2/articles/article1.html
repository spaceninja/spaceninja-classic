<big>Dr. Colossus Is Dead</big>
<br><small>News Article from <I>Blister</I> dated October 29, 1998</small>

<P>Dr Colossus was found in his converted school bus early Monday morning, apparently dead from four self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head. Band members discovered the gruesome tragedy Monday afternoon, when they went to search his bus for their missing musical instruments. With him was found a jar of formaldehyde, a surgical saw, and a detailed note describing the procedure for, in Dr Colossus' own words, "preserving my face for posterity." He apparently took great care in firing the suicide weapon, an antique Colt Peacemaker revolver, in such a way that only the back hemisphere of his skull was damaged. Coroners report that this is why it took him four shots. Band members confirmed that the note had been penned in his own hand, as it contained his signature smiley-face-dotted-I and the hearts and butterflies he was known to doodle in the margins.

<P>Following the tragic death of its frontman, the now infamous band Yellow Number Five has disbanded. The surviving members of the band made the announcement in a press conference at Portland State University on Tuesday in front of an audience of students who appeared "stressed." One student, a sophomore, was quoted as saying "When do we find out about financial aid opportunities?"

<P>Band member "Big" Ed spoke for the group and refused to answer any questions about the circumstances surrounding the death. Ed's girlfriend Amy appeared with red eyes, as did the final member, David, who frequently appears with red eyes.

<P>Ed also refused to answer any questions regarding the rumor that has sprouted recently that suggest that the artist formerly known as prince was considering attempting to join the band in Colossus' wake.

<P>This is not the first band member to die under mysterious circumstances. Regarding the earlier death in the band, the late Dr. Colossus had been quoted as saying "Shut up. We're not talking about that."
