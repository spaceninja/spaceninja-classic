[Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0076759) - A whiny kid from a barren desert planet finds out he has magic powers and a laser-sword, rescues a princess, and saves the galaxy with the help of a space pirate, a semi-retired Shakespearean actor, and a giant teddy bear.
[Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0080684) - The not-quite-so-whiny kid almost gets eaten by an abominable snowman, then goes to study magic under a Muppet, while this evil black dude tortures his friends in a floating city, and then he finds out that he's half-black, 'cuz the evil black dude's his father!
[Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086190) - The still-slightly-whiny-but-not-really-a-kid-anymore-guy hits on his sister, kills some pretty clueless guards, outsmarts some little teddy bears, gets captured anyway, fights with his absentee dad, barely escapes the space station which his friends destroyed without his help, and still gets all the credit. Some guys have all the luck. -----
