next month, the 13,000 page digest-sized softcover edition of the entire series will be released. you can [preorder it on amazon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/188896314X/qid=1086317080/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-2809594-5208829?v=glance&s=books) for $28 right now, or buy it for $40 in july.
