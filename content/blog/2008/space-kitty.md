[![Space Kitty](/images/2201341761_f4d91bba43.jpg)](http://casualgameplay.com/cgdc4/?gameID=24)

[Zach](http://zacharcher.com/) and [Miles](http://isometric.sixsided.org/) made a neat flash game called [Space Kitty](http://casualgameplay.com/cgdc4/?gameID=24) that combines my love of space-physics simulation and kitties! Jump from planet to planet, slingshot yourself around the gravity wells, and bring adorable kitties home from inhospitable asteroids!
