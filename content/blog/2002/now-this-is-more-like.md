[Now this is more like it.](http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0301-02.htm) Disease, flooding, desertification. Sounds like a party.

"The system is stable and reacts in a linear fashion as long as threshold values are not crossed..."
...But then, bam! [Abrupt climate change.](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/4/1362?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&titleabstract=catastrophic+climate+change&searchid=1028658384448_5938&stored_search=&FIRSTINDEX=0) I haven't really cared about America's ecological short-sightedness since high school. I mean, there are only so many things you can be angry about at once. So I've been looking at it with a sort of disinterested shrug of my shoulders. Yeah, I know we're causing global warming. I ride my bike. I turn off the lights when I leave the room. Maybe I'll get a [fuel-cell car](http://www.howstuffworks.com/news-item10.htm) if they ever become available. On the other hand, damn! If we really are going to get serious about non-polluting fuel sources, I'd better get myself that [Chevy Nova](http://students.washington.edu/crm2/Cars/Chevy%20Nova%20Grand%20Prix%20SS%201967.gif") while it's still legal!

So I read these news articles with a sadistic little smirk. When the [thermohaline circulation](http://www.climate.unibe.ch/~christof/div/fact4thc.html) shuts down, the oceans rise, forests migrate northwards, temperatures increase 5 to 10 degrees over a 10 year period, island nations are submerged, coastal properties are washed away, economies collapse, etc, I won't be the one who's surprised.
