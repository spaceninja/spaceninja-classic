I finally finished cleaning up all the MT template code to be valid XHTML (if you find any pages that don't validate, please let me know), and I finished all the little tweaks I've been planning to make to the CSS. You've all already seen it in action, obviously, but it's been growing and evolving a bit over the last week or so. Now my first completely modern standards-compliant CSS design is done, and I'm loving it!

Next up, I need to create another CSS file and impliment a skinning system using a cookie again, and then focus on my photoblog. ([To-Do List](/2004/08/blog-to-do-list/))

I'm glad I finished this work because this weekend I'm planning on attacking a few of the other blogs I'm involved in to make some of the changes I've discovered that have made my life easier with my MT installation.

I just realized that I never explained it, but this design is called Washington Street, and is named after the photo in the header, which is of the Washington Street footbridge in Indianapolis. I loved the way it looked at night, and the photo turned out so well, I wanted to show it off a bit.

Anyways, enough rambling. Time to play Fable.
