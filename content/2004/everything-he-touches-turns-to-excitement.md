I had a great weekend! On Saturday, I got together with Jill to discuss plans for [NewsBeat.org](http://www.newsbeat.org/), and help Eric with his computer problems (the poor guy is going to have to reformat). Then that night, Miles delivered the [KMorg Export Scripts](http://www.killingmachines.org/), so that I can allow the KMorg users to get their journal contents for use elsewhere. That was a huge weight off my shoulders. I knew I could write the script, but it was probably going to take me all week and frustrate me enormously, so I just paid Miles to do it instead. Money well spent, as far as I'm concerned.

Then on Sunday, I had the boys over to play war games. This was Colin's first week back in town, so he joined us as well. I rolled up an ork gang and got severly beaten by Aaron's new gang, while Colin took his new gang and **slaughtered** Sean's. By the end of the battle, four (out of 10) of Sean's gangers were suffering from the rules for Stupidity, and he's decided to disband that gang and roll up a new one.

Mostly, though, it was just fun to get everyone over and goof off. I'm really enjoying having a hobby that's unrelated to computers again, even if this hobby is even geeker than dorking around with computers all the time. I'm definitely enjoying a tactile activity.

Sean's going to come over on Wednesday and we're going to do some painting while watching the season finale of _Enterprise_ and WILL THE GEEKINESS EVER STOP?

Annie is nearly done with school now. Just a few weeks left. She's really busy all week with her final community project in her capstone class, then one more week of normal school, and then finals week, and then (hopefully) graduation!

We'll be pretty busy for a few weekends in a row there, going up north to hang out with Dave and Rose and find out what kind of baby they're going to have, and then Annie's graduation and Leilani's birthday party the next weekend, and then a big Father's Day get-together with my extended family.
