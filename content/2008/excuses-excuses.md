I know I've been slacking a bit lately when it comes to posting. I'm working on the draft for Zoe's one-year newsletter, but it's taking a bit longer than usual -- which I noticed the other day when she turned 13 months old. [It wasn't my fault!](it-wasnt-my-fault/)

Once again, Annie and Zoe are sick, and once again I'm trying desperately not to catch it. I really can't afford to miss any more time at work. Tonight I came home to help Annie put Zoe to bed, and while we were cleaning up the mess in Zoe's room from where she peed in the bed (and on the crib bumper, and on the floor), one of the cats threw up in the basement. I would mention that we're just lucky there wasn't a poop catastrophe at the same time, but I'm afraid of jinxing myself.

Anyway, long story short, Zoe's newsletter(s) are coming soon, and then I should be getting back to posting more frequently.
