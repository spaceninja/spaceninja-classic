It looks like I'm going to be unemployed by December. Nothing is 100% at this point, but my boss is closing down the company, and he says he will keep me on through the end of November if at all possible.

Obviously, this means I'm in the market for a job. I'm a highly skilled web developer, with advanced training in DHTML, XHTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and all aspects of running a large-scale site. I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, with a focus on web design. I love technology, and I have been working with computers for more than 10 years. I have work experience as a computer technician (2 years), a graphic designer (1 year), and a web developer (3 years). I work well in teams, and am highly motivated.

You can find my current contact information and my resume on my [portfolio](http://spaceninja.com/portfolio/) site.

If you or anyone you know of might be interested in hiring me, please feel free to contact me. Annie and I are still planning on moving to Puyallup at the end of the month, so anything in the Seattle area or telecommuting is fair game. Something design or computer related would be great, but at this point, I'm more concerned with just finding full-time employment.
