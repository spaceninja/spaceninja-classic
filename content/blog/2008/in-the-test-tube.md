This is, hands-down, the best discussion of climate change I've ever seen. By framing the argument in the context of risk management, he sidesteps the issue of whether or not climate change is real and whether it's man-made, and instead addresses the issue of what happens if we're wrong, regardless of what we decide.

> "What if I told you that I've got a way to look at it where you don't need to believe anyone, but you can still decide with confidence what we should do?"

If we agree with the activists and take big action now, we risk harming the economy as the skeptics warn. On the other hand, if we agree with the skeptics and do nothing, we risk environmental catastrophe.

> "While we debate whether humans can really change the climate or not, we are at the same time running the experiment. The kicker is that no matter what the outcome of the experiment, we're IN the test tube... and we only get to run the experiment once."
