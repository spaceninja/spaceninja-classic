<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/moving_van.jpg"><img alt="moving_van.jpg" src="/images/moving_van.jpg"></a></td><td>This moving van was FULL. Here it is already about a third unloaded. We had it filled to the ceiling all the way up to the door. Next time we're going to need a bigger truck.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/fully_loaded.jpg"><img alt="fully_loaded.jpg" src="/images/fully_loaded.jpg"></a></td><td>The moving van wasn't the only thing we loaded. Check out how low the rear wheel well is! That station wagon contains three computers, three monitors, all the stereo equipment, numerous speakers, and all of our plants and groceries.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/dining_room.jpg"><img alt="dining_room.jpg" src="/images/dining_room.jpg"></a></td><td>Our new dining room, crammed full of boxes and tables and chairs. To the left, you can see the pass-through counter into the kitchen, which is pretty nice.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/kitchen.jpg"><img alt="kitchen.jpg" src="/images/kitchen.jpg"></a></td><td>Our new kitchen is smaller than our one in Portland, but I'm already quite fond of the layout. My only gripe is the dishwasher and fridge are pretty small. Still, a dishwasher is a dishwasher, so I'm not complaining.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/living_room.jpg"><img alt="living_room.jpg" src="/images/living_room.jpg"></a></td><td>Here's the living room, full of couches and exercise machinery. To the left, past the file boxes is the dining room, and straight ahead is the balcony. Behind, is the hallway leading to the bedrooms.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/office.jpg"><img alt="office.jpg" src="/images/office.jpg"></a></td><td>Here's the second bedroom, which we're using as an office. We've got both desks running along the far wall, and it will have all the computers set up on it. In the photo, the office is still full of boxes, but we're working on opening it up and packing things away into closets and bookshelves.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/scott_working.jpg"><img alt="scott_working.jpg" src="/images/scott_working.jpg"></a></td><td>Annie couldn't resist snapping a photo of me working on Monday. Yes, in case you're wondering, that is my mac laptop propped up on top of all my comic boxes.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/annie_sleeping.jpg"><img alt="annie_sleeping.jpg" src="/images/annie_sleeping.jpg"></a></td><td>We got rid of our old mattress in Portland, because it was horrible and sagging, and came with mice. Unfortunately, our new bed hasn't gotten here yet, so we're sleeping on the hide-a-bed until then. It doesn't seem to bother Annie, though.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="odd"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/the_view.jpg"><img alt="the_view.jpg" src="/images/the_view.jpg"></a></td><td>Here's the scenic view off our balcony. The managers told us that this construction should be done in a month or two (not holding my breath) and that it's a bunch of new offices. It's not too bad, because it's not a super-noisy construction site.</td></tr><tr valign="top" class="even"><td><a href="http://spaceninja.local/gallery/Puyallup-MainSt/watching_tv.jpg"><img alt="watching_tv.jpg" src="/images/watching_tv.jpg"></a></td><td>Dave and Rose came over on Monday to hang out and we watched a bit of the new Star Wars DVDs. Here you can see that we've got the couches set up back-to-back, one facing the TV and one facing the fireplace. It's kind of neat, but I'm not sure it's the optimal arrangement yet. It definitely makes conversation a little more challenging.</td></tr></tbody></table>
