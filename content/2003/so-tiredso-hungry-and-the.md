so tired..so hungry.. and the activity never stops. today at lunchtime i'm picking up my tux and grabbing some chu's to go, so i can get back and finish up a project that i've been making slow-and-interrupted progress at for days. tomorrow morning, i'm meeting with a musician friend of mine who is trying to convince me (primarily by way of lavish praise) to go to music school, and then in the early evening we're all heading out to the rehearsal and dinner. friday is the wedding, of course. saturday, it looks like a bunch of us are going down to oktoberfest in mt angel. sunday i've got a work-party cookout. then the work week begins again..

looking back, too..i haven't had a moment's rest since the weekend before labor day weekend. i picked up a short-term rush contract job and worked through labor day weekend, went on-site during the next week, caught a quick flight down to the bay area and spent the night (and had the best 20 hours i've had in such a very, very long time), had the bachelor party, and with work-matters that leads us up to now.

if'n i don't slow down, i'm liable to get a virus!
