My mac laptop appears to have just fried itself. I installed the latest security patch last night, and then today, after about two minutes of running, the screen went crazy. I rebooted, and have yet to get anything but a blank screen since then.

**update:** I called apple tech support, and it turns out that even though my warranty just expired (mental note: ALWAYS buy the extended warranty), I qualify for a logic board replacement, free of charge! The bad news is that it will take 15-20 days after I ship it to them. They're sending me a box now, so I probably won't get my ibook back until after Christmas. Oh well - if they can fix it, it's worth it.

The frustrating part is that I was going to sit down and make a new set of backups today, when the computer crashed, so if they have to format the drive, I'll lose a month of emails and stuff.
