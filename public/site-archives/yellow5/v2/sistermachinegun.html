Okay. It's just come to my attention that you have a cover of one of my
songs on your 'Gas Food Lodging' album. I realize that sort of thing is what
you do, and have no qualms with that.

<p>I do, however, take issue with your doing it with my music, without so much
as asking. Artist to artist, I wonder what your motivation is to do such a
thing, because you stole from me, and for obvious reasons, I'm not very
happy with that.

<p>Your window of opportunity, in which you can do the right thing, is very
small. I've already informed my publisher, management, and legal affairs
teams. When they come calling, they will want to hear that either (a) you've
stopped sales of that record, or (b) our song was removed. If neither of
those things happen, we'll have no choice but to do what we have to do.

<p>-Chris Randall

Mr Randall...

<p>This is Scott Vandehey. I handle Yellow Number Five's affairs, and I need
to get some more information from you before we can decide how to proceed
on this issue.

<p>which song on Auto Life Fire? You can find a listing of tracks at

Ah... Christopher Randall of Sister Machine Gun! Sorry about the prior
email, it took a visit to the positron records page before I connected
your name with your band.

<p>I have only the highest respect for you and your music. So please allow me
to explain what's happened.

<p>Yellow Number Five doesn't actually exist. I'm a graphic designer, and in
high school I made up a fictional band so I could do CD cover designs. I
named the band after a small joke between some friends and I, and used
song titles from my favorite music to fill the album. Later, a friend and
I got really excited about the whole idea, and bought the domain
<a href="http://www.yellow5.com/">yellow5.com</a>, and created an entire fake history for the band. We used
photos of ourselves and made up fake names and personalities. We "created"
four albums for the band, each one filled with supposed covers of songs
that we enjoyed. We included a cover of a Sister Machine Gun song on the
second album (Gas Food Lodging).

<p>As you can see, no actual crime has taken place, and I apologize if you
were misled. We leave the site up because it amuses us to document the
fake history of this band. Take a peek at the news stories sometime...
they're all pretty odd stuff, but no matter how odd, people still seem to
believe it. We get fan mail. We've never advertised, but people find the
band and tell us that they love our music, which doesn't exist!

<p>My apologies once again on the misunderstanding, and (artist to artist) I
hope you understand that no disrespect was meant towards your music.

<p>That is too funny. When I first read your letter I about pissed myself. Just
out of curiosity's sake, how many labels have written you threatening
letters?

<p>In any case, no harm, no foul. Have a good time!!!

Actually, you're the first one. I was just bragging to my buddy that Y5

;) Out of curiosity, how did you hear of Y5?

<p>Thanks for being understanding!

<p>One of my fans found your site somehow and posted the addy on our Newsgroup.
I promptly started doing backflips, etc.

<p>That's a good joke, though. I've always wanted to start a ficticious band,
just to see how far I could take it without actually writing any music. I
guess I know now, so I don't have to. ;->
