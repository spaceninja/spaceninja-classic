Can I just take a second to brag about my nephew? Seriously, how freaking adorable is this kid? Look at that smile, and then the followup scowl. I love how expressive he is - and when he laughs, you can't help but laugh with him. (Photos from [Dave and Rose's flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/davstock/) photostream.)
