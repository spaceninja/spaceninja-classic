Ugh. Bad start to the day, so far. First I read that [story about Bush](/2004/05/trophy-case/), which kind of upset me, and then I had to spend the next hour sorting out my [tech support issues](/2004/05/transitional-woes/) with my new [hosting company](http://www.readysetconnect.com/). I was really hoping to start this week on more of an upbeat note. So, this is my attempt to let go of the stuff that's bugging me and start over in a better mood. Here are some good things that have happened recently:

1. Delicious pies for my birthday party at my parent's house.
2. Excellent breakfast at Kennedy School with Annie's mom yesterday.
3. Playing war games with Sean and Colin yesterday.
4. Actually managing to get Eric and Jill's computer working again!
5. Annie's nearly done with school, and seems to be doing well.
6. My birthday is tomorrow! (And Pat's was a few days ago - Happy Belated Birthday, Pat!)
7. I'm going out with KT to get fried chicken on my birthday.
8. I pre-ordered the games I want to buy, because I found out that ebgames.com won't charge you until the game ships, so now I'll be getting Doom 3, Half-Life 2, Fable, and Halo 2 when they're released.

Ah, I'm already feeling a bit better... now to get on with my day!
