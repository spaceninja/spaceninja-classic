sigh. well, in a few short days steph's websites will be off my server.. and thus ends one part of my life i'd hoped to treasure always. each day since has moved slowly, but all told time has gone by quickly.  
  
  
at least i have some interesting new diversions to keep me busy; my business to pursue (goal: time and money to vacation in a foreign country by the summer), my ongoing involvement as a fiddler and accordionist with the gypsy band Gaida and thara memory's community orchestra, and my latest hobby - taking pi for her daily runs in the forest after dark. it's exciting! our nightly excursions are getting scarier, the deeper into the woods we go.. :)  
  
as for gaida, we've a show coming up on the 28th of february.. we're playing in some kind of festival with several other folk bands, including some of minor but genuine celebrity (of course i don't remember who.) then we've got a show on march 14th; and beyond that the sky, according to my band-mates, is the limit.  
  
  
it's funny, as much as i enjoy playing music, i know already that my heart isn't wholly in it - it took me close to five years to discover that with martial arts..both an interesting diversion, but ultimately just a path that runs parallel to my own (in the case of martial arts, for a while- in the case of music..it could be a lifelong pursuit.) that doesn't mean that i don't take it seriously, of course, or that i don't plan on continuing to develop my technical and expressive skills with the instruments. but it isn't the goal, it isn't the end. something else is waiting for me..
