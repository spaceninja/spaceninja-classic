Uhh... almost done with the Basic Rights Oregon site...

It's funny. Web design is a completely different mindset from programming. I guess that's obvious, but it didn't really occur to me.

When you program, you focus monomanaically on this set of variables, procedures, and tasks that need to get done. It's almost like juggling, only instead of balls you have machine parts and you have to assemble them into a working engine without dropping anything. Any distraction is a major setback.

But building a website is more like one continuous stream of distractions; you have to take all these separate bits of information and puzzle them together such that they work together and are easy to navigate. More of a _herding_ process. And instead of communicating your intention to a machine, you're presenting your content to people; and hopefully making it easy enough for them to forget about the machine.

But when you're _also_ writing the code for the back-end... you can get confused. The ol' bug-eyed intense focus doesn't really help you assemble a site's content... it's a different "zone" to get into.
