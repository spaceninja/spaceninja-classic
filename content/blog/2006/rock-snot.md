I got an email from my Dad this afternoon:

> New invasive species and [guess what it's called](http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_073106_env_rock_snot.89840ef.html)...
>
> Makes me proud to live in a state where we name a town [Boring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boring,_Oregon) and a high-desert road "Stinking Water Pass" … entertain ourselves [dynamiting dead whales](http://www.perp.com/whale/) and [dropping napalm on stranded cargo vessels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Carissa) … hold both a "[Lumberjack Festival](http://www.lumberjack.org/west05/)" and a "[Faerie Festival](http://www.faerieworlds.com/)" within 40 miles of each other … all the while worrying about [rock snot](http://www.kgw.com/news-local/stories/kgw_073106_env_rock_snot.89840ef.html) in our fishing streams.
