Hey, I wanted to post about Thailand without parroting the depressing death tolls and high likelihoods of higher death tolls due to disease.

My friend Megan was scheduled to visit Phuket when the tsunami hit (literally: her plane took off an hour after it hit), and still went, although she changed her direction to a different town, on the other side of the country.

But she's glad she went, and she has a lot of great photos and stories about her experiences which she's helpfully posted here:

Please check it out, it's a great primer on basic Thai society and how other parts of the country are coping with the disaster. It's also refreshing to see that there's more to the country right now than the wiped-out beach towns we're seeing on the news. She's convinced me to visit when I can, and I hope you all feel similarly.
