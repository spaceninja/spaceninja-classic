If you haven't seen Casino Royale yet, go see it before you see this one. Unlike Bond movies in the past, which were all stand-alone, this is a true sequel to the first movie. It opens maybe an hour after the finale of Casino Royale, and jumps right into the action. Continuing their general theme of "Bond is an incredible bad-ass," this movie has gunfights, car chases, knife fights, airplane chases, fist fights, boat chases, and even an opera fight. Where the first movie was a little more cerebral, and spent a good hour focused on the poker game, this one is all action. I love the rebooted Bond, and this one definitely lives up to the old tagline, "[Everything He Touches Turns to Excitement!](/2000/10/everything-he-touches/)"
