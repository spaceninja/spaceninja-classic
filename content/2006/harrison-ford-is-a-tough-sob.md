> I was just trying not to get bruised. I wouldn't want to tumble with Harrison Ford in real life. He's a tough son of a bitch. I threw that man through a window seven times and he landed on his head, got up, rebuilt the window with the crew and then got thrown through it again. I hit that man in the stomach and he said, "Could you just land it a bit harder so I could feel it?" So I landed it a bit harder and he wanted a bit more so he could react to it. Finally, I just wound one up and let loose on him and he said, "That's it!" It was the most humiliating day of my life. \-- Paul Bettany on Harrison Ford
