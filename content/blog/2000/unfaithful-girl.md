This is brief entry. Following my alienation by my last girlfriend, I hooked up with the girl I cheated on her with. (interesting side note: the one who put us back in contact? The same girl who threw the party we met at, and later ratted me out to my girlfriend)

This "relationship," if you could call it that. Didn't last long. We didn't actually get along very well. On the plus side, I seemed to have finally learned my lesson and never told her I loved her.

We fooled around a bit, but never had sex. In hindsight, I'm amazed that I even hooked back up with her at all. The only thing we had in common was Outdoor School, which only carries a relationship so far, and I really wasn't that attracted to her physically.

Now, I've always believed that appearances took a strong second to how well you got along with a person, but when you don't get along very well, and you're not very attracted to her, there's not much left, right?

The thing that weirds me out about this now was that she had a lazy eye. I never quite figured out how to react to that. I never really knew which eye to look at, and it was pretty distracting.

After about a month, she dumped my lame ass to pursue one of my buddies from school. Much to my amusement, she failed miserably (he was oblivious).
