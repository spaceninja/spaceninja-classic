Upgrades upgrades upgrades

I barricaded myself in my office this weekend and cranked out the new design for \[http://www.killingmachines.org/\]. This new design is cleaner, faster, better designed, and has more features, such as statistic tracking (which is really only interesting to me), polls, and color switching. I'm sure no one cares about this as much as I do, but I'm really pleased with the results. I honestly think that KMorg is some of the best work I've ever done, and every time I do something to make it better, I get even happier.

Now I just need to get the login cookies working again. For some reason, they stopped working when I uploaded the new design.
