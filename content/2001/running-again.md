I finally got off my ass and started running again. I don't know why I always put these things off, but I got tired of it when I weighed myself and the scale leveled out 200 pounds. 200?! I weighed 130 in high school! I was a skinny geek!

I was nervous about starting to run again, because I tried about a year ago, and had to stop due to horrible pains in my legs. No, this was not just sore muscles. I've had that before and know how to deal with it. This was something else, and it was severe enough that I quit running. Well, I got started again today, and no leg pains! I think it might just be my shoes. I bought a cheap pair of running shoes when I started running again a year ago, and I think they might be too cheap.

And now for something completely different! I added two new comic links to the links page. [Red Meat](http://www.redmeat.com/) and [Maakies](http://www.maakies.com/) are both completely insane (and offensive at times) comic strips published in local independent newspapers. While I was in the heathen town of Ellensburg I was shocked to discover that many of the residents had never been blessed with the glorious knowledge of Milkman Dan or Drinky Crow. Here are a few samples. If you like what you see, follow the links!
