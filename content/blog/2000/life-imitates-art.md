Man... all the most twisted ideas I can come up with (without being artificial) appear in the paper eventually. Today there was an Edge about some idiot who got hospitalized for a tarantula bite on his penis, incurred while he was "admittedly under the influence of crystal meth."

And one of the CoDC pages has a [text file](http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_file/cDc-0344.txt) where this (alleged) phone sex operator complains about a certain caller's "bizarre fascination with frogs and death."

What is it with these people? I thought I was making this stuff up. Does this, like the discovery of life on _one_ extraterrestrial planet, imply the presence of similar phenomena _everywhere?_
