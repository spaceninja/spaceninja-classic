Well, we may not have made it out to La Pine (I'm sure Scott and Sean will fill y'all in on that once they return), but Molli and Leilani and I had a pretty good day, nonetheless.

Molli got enough studying done that she is at least, I believe, caught up, and can work tomorrow to get ahead, which is where she wants to be.

We answered an ad on craigslist, and picked up a jogging stroller somebody was selling for $40, in good shape. We've been looking for a second stroller, as our usage patterns have changed, and we no longer need a lightweight, easily-folded stroller with a carry strap (which was a necessity in Brooklyn). We need a heavy-weight, easy-to-maneuver stroller with big wheels--the sidewalks here are terrible, and the wheels on our spiffy Maclaren are only 3" in diameter.

We hung out with the neighborhood kids at a block party on our block, with a dunk tank and a bunch of drunken dads playing "beer pong", which was basically ping-pong where you tried to get the ball into somebody's beer, and mostly involved more drinking.

Then they started setting off fireworks, and we went inside, because A) the dads were still drunk, and B) Leilani was freaking out. So I sat with her and we watched the fireworks on tv, and she started pointing to parts of me and calling them by name (e.g. Nose, ear, etc), which she found very amusing.

Then she wanted me to read her a bedtime story, so I read chapter three of the book she picked out. Which, since Molli's taking an Algebra class, (and Leilani wants to do everything mommy does) was about first-degree equations.
