One time I peed on a guy. It was a long time ago, and I had forgotten all about it until some people on IRC were talking about how they had never urinated on anyone. I'm not sure how it came up, but it reminded me that I had. It was when I was in sixth grade, and at outdoor school (which is like camp, for anyone who doesn't know). If you had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you had to wake up your "buddy" and the two of you would walk over to the bathroom building together. I guess so we wouldn't get lost or something. Anyways, it was really dark, and we were both practically sleepwalking, and for some reason the light in the bathroom wouldn't turn on. I gave up on the lightswitch and stumbled my way into a stall. Inadvertently, I chose the same stall as my buddy. But I didn't realize this until I had started peeing and he yelled. I ran all the way back to the cabin, and he never mentioned it. I guess he must have been standing really close to the urinal and I was just far enough back not to notice him, but the point of the story is that as some people in the chat room remark that they've never urinated on anyone, I realized that I couldn't say that.
