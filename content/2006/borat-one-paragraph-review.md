[![Borat](/images/298406906_6f54fe1ea0_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298406906/)For weeks now, I have been reading [reports](http://washingtontimes.com/entertainment/20061112-105857-8742r.htm) about how Sacha Baron Cohen has manipulated, abused, and mistreated everyone from a morning show producer in Mississippi to frat boys in South Carolina. So, I feel a little guilty for loving the film. My face hurt from laughing so much, and Annie laughed so hard she nearly threw up. While it's not cool that Cohen misled people to get them in his film, these people are only angry because he outed them in front of the nation, when they thought their bigotry was safely hidden from view.
