> I never heard him called Professor Seemann. He was always Howard or Howie. When I went off to journalism school myself, it was strange to not be on a first-name basis with any of my professors. There wasn't a single one with whom I could casually belch and fart. I transferred as soon as I could. \-- from [Luke Seemann's wonderful eulogy for his father](http://www.seemann.com/dm/archives/2006/04/a_eulogy.html)
