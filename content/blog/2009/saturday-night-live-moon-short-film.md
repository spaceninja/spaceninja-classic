**Update:** It DOES exist! No sooner did I finish typing this than I managed to find a reference to it. It was directed by Adam McKay, it was called "Neil Armstrong: The Ohio Years," and it aired on [March 11, 2000](http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_1139.shtml). Now, I just need to hunt down the video.

Annie and I clearly remember an SNL sketch from maybe 10 years ago starring Neil Armstrong. It was a short film, very similar to the digital shorts they do today, with a little title card saying it was an SNL Short Film, and listing the director (who I don't remember).

The film itself just showed a normal day in the life of Neil Armstrong: Getting dressed, eating breakfast, picking up groceries at the store, etc. But over the top of everything, we hear Neil's inner monologue, which is all about him going to the moon. All day long, he's thinking things like "I went to the moon! I was on the moon. The moon! The god damn moon!"

And all day long, his inner monologue gets louder and more insistent, until by the time he's in the grocery store, you just hear him yelling "MOOOOOOOON!" over and over again. It was hilarious, because of the juxtaposition of this polite older man and his outragous inner voice.

And I can't find any indication that it ever existed. Annie and I remember it clearly, but no one else does, and there's no mention of it anywhere online. SNL doesn't appear in Neil Armstrong's IMDB page (or any of the other astronauts who landed on the moon). There's no mention in wikipedia. Google is no help. I'm seriously starting to wonder if I just dreamed it.

Do any of you remember this sketch? Better yet, does anyone have a copy?
