I love everything about the new BSG. The effects are great, the ships fly like they're in space, rather than atmosphere or underwater, there's no clinging to the status quo, and the writing is incredible. I love that the gritty chain-smoking Doc Coddle is named for the one trait he doesn't possess. I love that the show has more to offer that just huge battle scenes, and even during the biggest battle of the season, they spent more time focussing on the conflict between Adama and the Admiral, and you didn't mind at all.

The photo above is from a nice little [interview on CG Channel](http://cgchannel.com/news/viewfeature.jsp?newsid=4808&pageid=0) with Chris Zapara, the Digital Effects Supervisor at [Zoic Studios](http://www.zoicstudios.com/). He talks a bit about the effects, and what makes them different from Star Trek. When asked what was coming in season two, he replied:

> Expect to see some more battles, some more great character moments, and the surprising arrival of a race of evil space monkeys. Or at least two of those. \-- Chris Zapara of Zoic Studios

Interestingly, while trying to figure out the correct spelling of "frakking" for the post title, I eventually found the answer while rereading [Ron Moore's blog](http://blog.scifi.com/battlestar/archives/2005/02/index.html), but it seems that [Google has its own thoughts on the matter](http://www.google.com/search?q=galactica+frak).

_Did you mean: galactica **frack**?_
