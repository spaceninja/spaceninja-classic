Last night at Corey's party, we met an awesome girl named Heather. She is like a freaky combination of Urn and Kat and Annie and I all rolled up in one person. (Or perhaps the four of us are like if she got divided into four distinct persons by a freakish science experiment involving _Gamma Radiation_!!) She's crafty, she dislikes typos, she likes Red Elvises and Pink Martini, she likes comic books and zombie movies, and she has a website at [LittleCabbage.com](http://www.littlecabbage.com/). I think we're going to have to steal her from Corey.
