Over the weekend, our friend Becky came to stay with us. Thankfully, I got paid a few days early due to the holiday, so we could afford to do a few things.

Friday night, we went to Sukhothai, an incredible Thai restaurant on 20th and Broadway. We found the place several months ago when the whole group went there for Zach's birthday. This time, Sean and Gwen came with us, and we stuffed ourselves. They have a dish called Sukhothai Delight, which is their house version of Pad Thai, and it's awesome.

After that, we headed back to our place, and watched the Daily Show, and I showed everyone the episode from the day before when they covered Zell Miller's "speech" and his interview on Hardball where he challenged Chris Matthews to a duel.

Saturday we rolled over to the beach, where we bought ice cream at the Cheese Factory, and visited my parents at the cabin. It was a nice relaxing day, we didn't really have any goals other than getting to the beach, so we could just hang out and talk. We had pizza for dinner, and then came home and played video games.

On Sunday, I woke up before Annie and spent the whole morning playing _Beyond Good And Evil_, and xbox game that Becky brought with her. When game magazines put out a list of the "top 10 games you've never played but should", this game is always in the top three, no matter which magazine puts it out. I've actually been thinking about picking it up for a long time, but after playing Becky's copy all weekend, I bought a used copy for $15.

The game is hard to describe. First of all, it's beautiful. It's very well-designed, and has a kind of exaggerated cartoon-like quality to everything, but it's done well enough that it can pull off serious moments as well as funny. The main character is awesome. She's a fairly normal looking woman (meaning she's attractive by real-world standards, and isn't some freakishly top-heavy video game chick), who happens to know staff fighting. The game opens with some combat, but that's all the combat you'll see for awhile. You actually spend most of your time taking photos of animals.

Anyways, like I said, it's hard to describe, but it's awesome, and it's one more thing for me to play while I'm waiting for Fable, Half-Life 2, and Halo 2.
