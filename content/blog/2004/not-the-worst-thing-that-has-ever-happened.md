and certainly better than paying first term tuition at psu\* with insurance from my stolen bicycle, because i didn't get paid at the koin for nearly two months after starting...

but anyways. i just pulled out my financial aid notification, while on my way to figure out which classes i wanted to register for tomorrow. when it showed up the other day i looked at it long enough to see that they were offering me the same loan as last time\* then set it aside for later reference. since then i've had this nagging feeling in the back of my head that it was actually for fall/winter/spring and not summer/fall/winter. because i wanted to start summer term and not fall, but i don't have the money to go summer term without financial aid.

guess who's not going back to school until september.

_\*yes, i could have graduated by now if i hadn't dropped out three years ago. although, if i'd questioned my major in that time i could easily still be floundering around in the college system, accruing massive loan debt, and not be any closer to where i am now. re: smarter, more focused._
