W00T! We have a dishwasher! Here's the one we got, if anyone cares: [Kenmore 17822 Portable Dishwasher](http://www.sears.com/sr/product/summary/productsummary.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1907768125.1039109325@@@@&BV_EngineID=ccjgadcglmlgfedcehgcemgdffmdflg.0&vertical=SEARS&pid=02217822000&sid=I0008300030000100085). We finished getting it set up last night, and it seems pretty cool! Today I'll actually be running dishes through it. Anyways, enough posting about appliances that no one really wants to hear about. The point it, Annie and I got a dishwasher, and we're stoked about it!
