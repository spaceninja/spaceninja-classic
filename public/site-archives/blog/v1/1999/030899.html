<BR>"I am...
<BR>I am Superman...

<BR>~REM, I think

<P>Oog. Dead Week. It sucks. The end of the term, when suddenly you become painfully aware of just how much work you have to accomplish and just how little time you have to do it in. A week full of nights with 3 hours of sleep, caffinated beverages, and occasional breaks to watch Star Trek and X-Files just to relieve your brain of thinking for a bit. The kind of week where you call your girlfriend and you're so braindead that you just sit, and say nothing to each other because you can't think of anything other than the exact details of the life of the average peasant in 13th century England. But the best part is that neither one of you minds, because its reassuring just to share a few minutes, even in silence.

<P>I downloaded the new version of ICQ the other night, when I should have been working, and I like it. It's got all sorts of new toys worked in, like the ability to send color messages. That's great. I need more toys. I like buttons and knobs and dials and switches. The more the better. If they have to put on extra buttons that do the same thing as another buttons somewhere else, that's fine by my. I feel the same way about pockets. You can't have too many.

<P>Hee hee... I just spellchecked this... and it tried to replace "braindead" with "brandied". My spell checker is verbing.

<P>I was at Annie's house, and I realized that I had left a note on Dave's door 7 weeks ago, saying "I can see you perfectly through my rifle scope." It was a reference to some joke we had been telling that weekend. I can't remember the joke. I still laughed at it, because I remembered it being funny, but I couldn't repeat the joke to you... It's lost... Maybe my brain is full.

<P>I think this is short attention span theater. I've been working all day writing short term papers and now I'm burned out on proper grammar and logical sentence constructions and stuff. You get the flotsam and jetsam of my brain. Which is what this is all about, really.

<P>A few months ago, KT was playing Diablo at our apartment. Now the other week, I just got Annie reading a comic book (the Maxx!). I think I'm a bad influence on people. I'm spreading my geek-ness around.

<P>I realized that it's heriditary. My family sat down to eat dinner at a nice restaurant in Seattle (with Annie) and Sean ordered yakisoba. When the plate of noodles arrived, my dad looks at it, and then looks at Sean and says "look, Sean, they brought you a plate of Gak!", and we all chuckeled. All of us, my mom, dad, Sean and Ryan, and me... Annie might have too, but I don't think she caught the Star Trek reference. So it runs in the family. Chromozone 40K - The Star Trek Gene...

<P>My tax return got here today. It rocks to get a check in the mail. :) I'm going to buy a coat, pay my parents off, get a Monster card for my computer and maybe a CD burner.

<P>Blah Blah Blah. The End.
