[![War of the Worlds Poster](/images/2853941786_7e8f115593_o.gif)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2853941786/)

Check out the poster I made for the radio station's Halloween broadcast of War of the Worlds! I'm pretty pleased with the way it turned out, even though the [propaganda](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/obey/v2/) look I like so much doesn't translate super-well to black and white. Still, the productions manager assures me that making it black and white means we can make more and larger copies of the poster to put around campus. So I did it, and I like it! In hindsight, black and white is more appropriate for something in the 1930s, anyway.

Jill, the news director from the radio station called me up tonight and asked me to do an interview on the air tomorrow night with some right-wing guy. Should be interesting. It's cool that she called me.

Oog. I need a job. But right now, I'm going to go work on [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/).
