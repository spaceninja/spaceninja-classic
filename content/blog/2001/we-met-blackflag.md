Last night, KT, Steve, Annie and I all went to a bar called the Blue Moon to meet [blackflag](http://www.hatelife.org/view.php?user=blackflag) from [hatelife](http://www.hatelife.org/). I must admit, I had some reservations. I've only met a couple people from online, and those meetings were horribly awkward and uncomfortable.

This meeting, however, was great. We all ordered some food and drinks, and then we complained about the crummy service while we waited for our orders to arrive. The conversation wandered all over the map. There was some discussion of hatelife and other online stuff, naturally, since Steve and I like to talk about ourselves and it was one thing we all had in common. But we talked about lots of other things and had a great time. When we left the bar, we ended up all going back to Steve's house to watch _the Tao of Steve_, which I had never seen, and I loved.

End result: Blackflag is a cool guy that we all had fun meeting. He's currently considering moving to Portland, which we all encouraged him to do. It would be nice if he moved here, because he fit right into our little group.
