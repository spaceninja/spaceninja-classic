Continuing her tradition of kick-ass gifts, KT gave me a fondue set for my birthday. While she was in town this weekend, we decided to get together with Steve and Miles and have a fondue night. After we looked up how to make fondue on the web, we got the ingredients and managed to make a pretty good one! Thanks, KT!

Also, I finally managed to get the new design for [Killing Machines](http://spaceninja.com/site-archives/kmorg/v2/) posted. Hopefully now Steve will get the user login options coded up so that I can enable skins for journals, too.

Having all this spare time is a little frustrating, because I feel motivated, but some things I just don't have the resources to do right now. For instance, I would love to start doing Poekoelan (did I spell that right?) with Steve, but I can't afford the classes (or health insurance) until I get a job. I'd also love to teach myself some programming, but I can't afford any manuals, and my net connection isn't good enough to just do it all online. Oh well... hopefully I'll find a good job soon.

Oh, and I finally broke down and renewed [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.com/) with Network Solutions. The domain transfer to joker.com got canceled AGAIN. This time, Network Solutions said it was because my account is not paid. So they want me to renew my account for a full year just so I can transfer it to another registrar and not use the services they want me to pay for. Joker emailed me and said that Network Solutions is denying transfers that they are supposed to be approving, and that I can possibly try the transfer again for free when Network Solutions stops breaking the rules. Ugh.
