Last year I succeeded at 50% of [my resolutions](/blog/2009/new-years-resolutions-2009/). I successfully uploaded all my old photos to flickr, but I wasn't able to entirely give up soda at my desk. It went great for about six months, and then we had a big deadline, and I started up again. I felt pretty good about lasting six months, though.

This year, I have only one resolution: I signed up for [Project 52](http://project52.info/) over on [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.com/). The idea is to post fresh content at least once a week, all year long. I'm aiming to make the content worthwhile, with no fluff. I want to write a lot of good content about web development, to start advancing my ultimate goal of becoming a name in the industry.

The flip side of that resolution is to post more worthwhile stuff over here. I've been reading through my archives, and I used to write a lot more. In the last few years, however, I basically only write about Zoe and my work. I miss that "here's what's happening with me right now" kinda vibe that blogging used to have. Since I've split my professional life into its own blog, there's no reason to hold back anymore, so I'm going to try to be more personal on here again.
