[Hanzi Smatter](http://www.hanzismatter.com/) is a blog "dedicated to the misuse of Chinese characters in Western culture." The focus seems to be on people who get tattoos of Kanji that are either written incorrectly or don't mean what they thought. My favorite entry is [Peter](http://www.hanzismatter.com/2005/11/peter.html), who thought he was getting his own name tattooed on his leg, and instead got the name of a Chinese electronics company.
