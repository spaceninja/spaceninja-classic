<big>Fat Agnes - demo tape</big>

<P>Good luck finding this one.  Made late in 1994, this tape containing four cover songs was sent to just about anyone who might have published or reviewed it.  Only one person responded to the band's demo, Jim Kirch of Blister Magazine.  He referred to the band as "the festering scar on Portland's otherwise unblemished local music scene.  [Y5] is a product of poor education, a pollution in the gene pool, and a sad testament to the fact that these days, anyone can be a rock star."

<p>play list:
<ol>
<li>Who's Sorry Now?                    (Willie Nelson)
<li>Brain Damage                           (Pink Floyd)
<li>Some Like It Hot                (the Power Station)
<li>Gypsy                               (Fleetwood Mac)
</ol>
