This weekend Zoe started walking! She's taken a few steps before, but it was always like she didn't really realize she was doing it - and we could never get a repeat performance. We were at her friend Maia's first birthday party, and she stood up, raised her arms over her head and looked at me like, "Do you see what I'm doing? This is pretty cool, right?" Then I held out my arms and she took about five steps right to me. We didn't have the camera out, but thankfully she did it again later that night.
