I'm a stand-up-comedian on the death star. I'm "entertaining" hoards of young children, all dressed like Darth Vader. I'm aware of the fact that these children are trained to infiltrate the normal ranks of troops and report suspicious activities. They start out looking like Darth Vader, and each year, they get demoted a rank until they're cadets and no one suspects them.

I'm not a very good comedian, and I'm kinda nervous that the kids might do something to me, so I start taunting the one kid who doesn't have a uniform. He glares at me darkly.

I'm at the beach cabin. I'm running circles around it outside for some reason, and it's really dark. The grass is wet and I'm worried about how I will get back inside, though I can see people in there. I'm back inside, and we're all really nervous about something, and we're getting ready to run. I remember something about a train. My girlfriend asks me to bring the VCR. I'm trying to talk the people who are sleeping in my bed into coming with us, but they won't. There's two couples in the bed and one single girl, who I know very well and I really want to run with us (staying behind is bad, somehow). She doesn't want to come. We pack up our stuff, including an alarm clock and a VCR and lots of other stuff and run. The train again? As we're running we're pounding on the door of a woman's house. As we're waiting for her to answer, I notice that there's an amazing cliff under the fence right next us. There's a big gap under the fence, and I can see a huge grassy cliff going down to a river way way down. I fall, somehow, and am nearly hysterical for fear of my life when I manage to scrabble back up to where my friends are standing (I don't know who these friends were... I must have known them in the dream, but here in the waking world I can't place them). I wake up remembering that I was in a shooting range trying to buy ammo for my gun, and I have a hunting knife in my belt.
