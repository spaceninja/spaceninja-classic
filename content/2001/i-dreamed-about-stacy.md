Have you ever had something happen to you that people claim happens all the time but you've never quite believed?

Let me explain, one of my best childhood friends, Stacy, died recently in a horrible car crash caused by a drunk driver. Even though I've been to two memorial services for her, I've been having a lot of trouble convincing myself that she's actually dead. This is largely due in part to the fact that I haven't seen her since we graduated high school four years ago. I was off at college, she was off at college... I always figured we'd see each other again someday... well apparently someday doesn't come for everyone.

I didn't realize how much I didn't want to admit she was really gone until last night when my friend was asking me questions about Scott and I said I didn't want to talk about him because then I'd really start to miss him. In my head I immediately thought, "just like Stacy."

So here's the crazy part. She came to me in a dream last night. I didn't dream about her. she visited me. It seems weird when I write it out, but it seemed perfectly natural last night. I knew she was dead, and that I was dreaming, but I also knew that was the only place we could say goodbye. She came to me so we could see each other and talk again, just like we would have if she'd lived. I think now that I've seen her one last time I can admit that she's really gone.

Damn.
