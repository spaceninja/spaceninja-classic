Long story short, I thought it was great. Harrison Ford pulls off the "aging action hero" thing perfectly. Indy is a little rusty, but still just a likely to throw a punch as to recite obscure historical details from memory. Similarly, Shai LaBeouf, who I expected to find annoying, fills the role of "young punk turned into reluctant sidekick" really well. I've been reading all sorts of mixed reviews, and even the people I know were split pretty evenly down the middle between really liking it and being kind of unimpressed. My take on it is that Indy4 suffers from the same problem as the Star Wars prequels, in that some people have built the originals up in their minds to the point where no sequel could possibly satisfy them. If you're one of those people, or if you're expecting something radically different from the previous movies, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you're looking for more of what made the first movies great (straight action with little concern over the larger implications of the fantastic discoveries that Indy makes), you'll walk out very happy, like me.
