**This is the best thing ever in the history of all things.**

[Sean](http://nyarlo.net/) casually told me that he had seen a cool music video the night before on the wacky Chinese music video program he tapes. He mentioned something about soccer and kung fu. I was completely blown away when he showed it to me. The video is basically a collection of action shots, which means it's either an artsy music video, or a video for a movie. It's about a soccer team that does kung-fu. Random impressions:

- Guy does a flying side kick, sending the soccer ball flying through the air, where it ignites into fire, and the fire is shaped like a tiger.
- Everyone on the team doing a break-dancing-style back-spin, where their legs are twirling through the air, and they're kicking a soccer ball back and forth.
- The goalie falling into a kung-fu stance, and doing the Bruce-Lee-come-here hand move.
- The main kicker with a huge load on his back, kicking a fridge through the air.
- The main kicker doing a hacky-sack kind of thing... with an egg.

The song was cool too, but I was completely amazed by the soccer team doing kung fu. I really cannot explain to you how amazing this was. Then we got online, and did a google seach for "kung fu soccer chinese music video." The [search](http://www.google.com/search?q=Shaolin+Soccer) revealed to us that [Stephen Chow](http://www.shaw.com.sg/upload/shaolinsoccer/m-shaolinsoccer.htm) is directing and [starring](http://www.upcomingmovies.com/shaolinsoccer.html) in a [movie](http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/review/review_shaolinsoccer.html) called [Shaolin Soccer](http://www.totallyhk.com/TimeOff/Entertainment/Article/FullText_asp_ArticleID-20010712123644578.asp), out in Hong Kong now, which will be released by Mirimax here in the States sometime in 2002.
