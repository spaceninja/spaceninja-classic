Friday will be my last day at [Pop Art](http://www.popart.com/). I've been working there nearly four years, and deciding to quit was not an easy decision. I won't get into all the details, suffice to say that it's time for me to move on, and I'm ready for some new challenges.

Over the years at Pop Art, I've worked with a lot of great people, many of whom I would work with again in a heartbeat. I've learned a lot, and I also feel like I made a real difference. Together with other front-end developers like Libby Molina and Ryan Parr, we've shaped the production process and made top-notch standards-compliant code one of the things that Pop Art is known for. I'm proud of that legacy.

All in all, I'm stoked. It was definitely time for a change, and this feels like a really good one. I'm sure I'll be posting more details soon, but in the meantime, wish me luck!
