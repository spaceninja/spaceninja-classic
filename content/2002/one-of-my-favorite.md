One of my favorite computer games of all time has to be Syndicate, an old game from Bullfrog. The plot was simple... you control a team of genetically enhanced super-agents, and you have to wipe out the other syndicate's teams. The game play was fairly unique at the time. You had an overhead view of all four of your team members, and you had to keep them doped up on various response-improving drugs and guide them in the right direction to accomplish whatever the mission was (mafia-style stuff, usually... "convince" this person to work for us, kill this person, eliminate all enemies).

Anyways, I had a blast playing it, and recently I discovered that there was a SuperNintendo version. I quickly found a copy and discovered that while the gameplay is pretty much exactly the same, they changed the artwork, and now my hardcore gritty game is kinda cute! I've posted a few comparison pics here for you to see.
