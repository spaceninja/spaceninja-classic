<ul>
<p><li>Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: "Shut up, dammit, all of you just shut UP!"

<p><li>Whistle the first seven notes of "It's a Small World" incessantly.

<p><li>Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.

<p><li>Wear "X-Ray Specs" and leer suggestively at other passengers.

<p><li>Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside, ask: "Got enough air in there?"

<p><li>Offer name tags to everyone getting on the elevator.  Wear yours upside-down.

<p><li>Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.

<p><li>When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.

<p><li>Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.

<p><li>Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: "I've got new socks on!"

<p><li>Meow occasionally.

<p><li>Bet the other passengers you can fit a quarter in your nose.

<p><li>Walk on with a cooler that says "human head" on the side.

<p><li>Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce "You're one of THEM!" and move to the far corner of the elevator.

<p><li>Wear a puppet on your hand and use it to talk to the other passengers.

<p><li>When the elevator is silent, look around and ask "Is that your beeper?"

<p><li>Say "Ding!" at each floor.

<p><li>Say "I wonder what all these do" and push the red buttons.

<p><li>Listen to the elevator walls with a stethoscope.

<p><li>Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and accounce to the other passengers that this is your "personal space."
