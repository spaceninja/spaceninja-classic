Happy [CSS Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/)! Dustin Diaz started this in 2006 as a way to promote web standards.

> "In the spirit of promoting Web Standards along with good semantic markup and proper hierarchy structures, \[today\] will be a day of nakedness for all webmasters to remove their style sheets from their website for one day. ...The fact of the matter is, if you’re writing good solid markup to begin with, it shouldn’t be all that bad anyway." \-- Dustin Diaz, [First Annual Naked Day](http://www.dustindiaz.com/naked-day/)

It was a good idea then, and it's a good idea now. If you've got a site, why not turn off the styles for a day and join in the fun?

**Note:** If you're still seeing my design, hit "refresh" in your browser to strip the styles out.
