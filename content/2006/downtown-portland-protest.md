This was the view out my window a few minutes ago. There was a pretty good sized protest marching directly past our new office on Broadway and Alder, and I had a pretty good view, so I took some photos, which I've [uploaded to flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/archives/date-taken/2006/10/05/). My coworkers weren't sure what to make of it all. I wonder if I'm the only one here who wanted to go outside and join the march?
