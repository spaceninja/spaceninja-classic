Last night we got a call from my brother, Ryan. He sometimes posts here and at other sites as Rye Bread. He's currently living in New York. He decided that college wasn't doing it for him, and moved to the other coast. None of us were really sure what to make of it, but he seems to be thriving over there, so we're happy for him.

Anyways, he called last night to tell us that he's getting married (Now, I didn't even know that he was living with his girlfriend...). Apparently his friends in New York are less than supportive of his relationship, so they're planning to just get married at the courthouse on Halloween, and then throwing a wedding party in a few years, "when they know who their friends are."

I'm afraid I came off poorly on the phone. I tried to be supportive, but I think I ended up sounding skeptical. It was just a little to much to digest all at once that my little brother is engaged. Annie joked that at least we wouldn't be the first ones to get married, and my family made several jokes hinting that if Annie and I hurry, we could beat him to it.

And in completely unrelated news, Steve had a bad experience getting his new car stereo installed, we completed the new edit page and will have it up soon, and I seem to be a little closer to finding gainful employment.
