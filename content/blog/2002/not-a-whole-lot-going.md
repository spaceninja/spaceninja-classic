Not a whole lot going on in my life lately, so I'm going to post some links to sites that have been grabbing my attention lately.

- [Arecibo Reply](http://amo.net/Contact/): In 1974, we sent a binary message towards the M13 globular star cluster using the Arecibo radio telescope. On August 18th, 2001, a reply appeared in a wheat field in Chilbolton, England. Regardless of whether it was sent from space or was made by humans as a prank, the modifications made to the message are interesting.
- [Ghost In The Shell TV show](http://www.production-ig.com/Ghost_TV.html): Currently being made by Production I.G, who have made some other cool stuff.
- [Goofy Animations](http://www.weebl.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/b3ta/pie.html): The everyday happenings of Weebl and sometimes his friend Bob. Be sure to check out the "Yarr" episode.
- [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/) and [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/): Both services are offering free poster printing. I'm going to check out the latest quality of their merchandise and then update [the Space Ninja Store](http://store.spaceninja.com/)
- [Halo's Story](http://halo.bungie.org/story/): The more I play Halo, the more impressed I am with the detailed plot line that Bungie created for this game, and the more it becomes obvious that it's tied in with the plot line for their earlier series of games, [Marathon](http://marathon.bungie.org/story/).
- [James Kolchalka's Sketchbook Diary](http://www.americanelf.com/): Miles introduced me to James Kolchalka, and his goofy comic strips. Now he has a daily journal in the form of a comic strip.
- [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/): There's always something cool to look at on DeviantArt. If you can't find a good starting place, check out my [Favorites List](http://spaceninja.deviantart.com/favorites).
