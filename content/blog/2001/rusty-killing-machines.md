As some of you will no doubt have noticed, WWW.killingmachines.org is now a redirect to RUSTY.killingmachines.org. Please change any links or bookmarks to reflect this change. There are a few reasons for the new address. One is that Rusty.KillingMachines sounds really cool. Another is that I'm going to be making some design changes to this weblog very soon. But the major reason is an experiment I will be starting soon.

I'm going to start a 'zine, which will be hosted on www.killingmachines.org. At the moment, this project is still largely undefined, and is sort of a general interest pop culture webzine. I'm hoping to release it monthly, and I will be performing as editor. I'm currently looking for talent to write for it. If you are interested, send me a sample piece of writing to \[email deleted\]. Be aware that I will be expecting a new article every month. That being said, it's wide open. You can write about whatever you like, from humor to news to reviews.

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Killingmachines is offline, but after www moved to rusty, it moved to rusted, and then ended up here. So you're already in the right place.
