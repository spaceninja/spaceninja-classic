Last night, as Urn and Kat and Annie and I dined with Eric and Jill (our fabulous managers from the radio station), Jill mentioned that she wanted to throw a _Red Dwarf_ themed Halloween party. When I mentioned that I had never seen the show, everyone got that horrified look and gasped (even Annie!) and Jill immediately sat me down on the couch to watch the out-takes tape, while Urn explained the basic "plot" of the show (I have a feeling that plot is too kind a word).

Needless to say, I'm hooked. I'm going to start borrowing the tapes from Urn and educate myself in the ways of [Red Dwarf](http://www.reddwarf.co.uk).
