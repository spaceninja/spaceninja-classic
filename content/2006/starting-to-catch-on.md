> "Imagine that Lord of the Flies was written by Lewis Carroll, adapted for stage by Jules Verne, scored by Paul Mercer and performed aboard the Hindenburg, and you're starting to catch on." \-- Eliza Gauger from Kotaku reviewing [Rule of Rose](http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/rule-of-rose/rule-of-rose-first-impressions-200802.php)
