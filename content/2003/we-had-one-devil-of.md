we had one devil of a good day at the coast today. i am happy. i showered off a few minutes ago so my bed would not fill with sand, but the faint odor of fire lingers. happiness ensues. i think pi has never been happier than sitting around the campfire eating sausages with us. \[segue: i in fact saw a side of her i'd never seen before.\]  
  
we talked about studio fojar matters for hours. we talked about art, philosophy, love, loss. my friends are such interesting people. miles and i nailed down some pertinent and important technical issues to the software, which salves my tattered soul. we all three of us answered some important questions about "fojar: the business."  
  
  
it was a vacation. it was ... "exactly what i needed." all the other outcomes were, though far more beneficial long-term, less important to me than taking a big step out of my ordinary frantic life-as-a-freelancer. a breath of fresh air. fresh sea air, too. yarrrrr. thanks, guys!  
  
  
it's late..i'm sure i'll regret this post in the morning. in the meantime, [enjoy this mp3 i recorded](http://fojar.com/~steve/music/accordion/maggot.mp3)! \[aside: it's an old english folk tune.\]
