Sean and Ryan are playing the Halo 3 Beta. They're both on the Red Team. Ryan jumps up on top of the base to grab the Spartan Laser. Before he knows what's happening, another player jumps up and kills him. Cursing, he observes that the player that just killed him is also wearing red armor. Sean says, "Wait, was that you?"

After a brief discussion where Ryan and I "suggested" a few ways that Sean could remember which team he was on, they keep playing.

Awhile later, Ryan is excited because another red player has given him a ride to the Blue Team's base, where he has successfully stolen the flag. He remarks that all he has to do now is stay alive long enough for the other player to drive him back to base. Halfway back, they drive over a trip mine hidden by the rise of a hill and explode. We notice that the caption on screen says they were killed by Sean, who sheepishly admits to dropping the trip mine there earlier, not knowing they would be driving near the Blue base.
