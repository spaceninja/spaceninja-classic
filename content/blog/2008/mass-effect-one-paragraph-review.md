I was just looking through my draft posts and noticed that I never actually posted my One Paragraph Review for Mass Effect. And that's sad, because I absolutely loved the game. In fact, the reason I didn't post the review is because I decided I didn't want to review it until I beat the game, but I forgot that I'm incredibly slow at RPGs because I'm a leave-no-stone-unturned kind of gamer. Add to that the fact that after I beat the game once, using my lawful-good style character, I took Daniel's advice and played through again with the intention of being a chaotic-evil kind of guy. It was a lot of fun, but since the storyline ultimately involves you saving the galaxy, you can't be all that evil, so I just ended up playing a total dick. It was a lot of fun, but I guess I was a little disappointed that I wasn't given the option of going full-on Darth Vader on the universe. Still, for all I'm complaining, I played through the game twice without batting an eye, and was in the middle of playing through a third time when Grand Theft Auto 4 came out and stole all my game time. Long story short, if you enjoyed KOTOR or any of Bioware's other RPGs, you're going to dig this.
