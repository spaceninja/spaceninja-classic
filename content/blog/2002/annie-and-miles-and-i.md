Annie and Miles and I went to the KOIN tonight and saw _Windtalkers_. It was kind of disappointing. Luckily, after that, we stuck around to catch a screening of _Lilo & Stitch_, the new Disney film, and it's **Genius**. This is not only the best Disney cartoon ever made, this is an all around good movie. It's extremely funny and clever, so do yourself a favor and skip the war film to go see the cartoon about an alien killing machine who befriends a hawaiian family. :)
