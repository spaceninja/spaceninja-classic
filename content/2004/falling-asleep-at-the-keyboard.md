My allergies have been kicking in hardcore style this week.

The weather's been nice the past few days, so we've been leaving the windows open (the old men downstairs leave their heat on no matter what season it is), and as a result, I've been getting the itchy, watery eyes, the runny nose, the headaches and other general malaise that signals (for me) the arrival of spring.

I've also been tired. Mad tired. Like, put-Leilani-to-bed-and-sit-down-to-check-e-mail-and-fall-asleep-in-the-chair tired. A lot of times, I'm tired enough that if I sit down for too long, I don't want to get back up; that's the curse of parenthood, especially when your daughter's almost two.

But it's not usually so bad that if I sit down for more than a few minutes I fall asleep.

On the plus side, I got a bottle of benadryl, and they've got new _Ultratab_ tablets, which are basically super-condensed tablets that are really tiny. So every time I take my allergy medicine I feel like I've suddenly turned into a giant.
