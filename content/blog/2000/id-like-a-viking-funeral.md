I'd like a Viking funeral, personally... a big pyre, drinking, fires. All my favorite websites have black backgrounds for a day (geek alert!). Several famous supermodels shave their heads. And, of course, my enemies will be sentenced to the [toad bucket](http://isometric.sixsided.org/_/nothing_but_war/).

I updated the desktops section again. There's a ton of good desktops I'd like to share, but some of the artists are turning me down, preferring to leave them on their sites. I didn't want to set up a links page to "good" wallpaper sites, since that's totally overdone, but I might have to in order to share them.

I made Annie watch _Braveheart_ for the first time last night. I forgot how many good lines are in that movie. "Oh, it's good Scottish weather, ma'am! The rain is falling straight down, and only a little to the side-like." ...and... "An Irishman has to talk to God in order to find his equal."
