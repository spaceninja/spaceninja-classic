I, like Scott, have been drawn recently into this phenomenon known as "blogging". I've been reading a lot of 'blogs online, and following links to new 'blogs, and basically discovering a whole community of new things to read, which is all I really ever wanted out of the internet, anyway.

What I like about 'blogs in general, and things like Movable Type in particular, is that when I started out making a webpage, it was such a damn hassle to re-code every page by hand every time you put up something new. Now you can install something like Movable Type, and BAM! you've got an instant update system, that not only archives everything and keeps the most recent stuff up top, but provides built-in, easy navigation through the entire site, and allows you to create a nice layout and change it around easily and quickly.

If Movable Type had existed in 1997, my webpage wouldn't have sucked quite as much. Now I feel like the uprising in blogs, many of which look extremely slick and professional, is finally creating the kind of online community that I started creating a webpage to be a part of in the first place.

**Hoo-ray!**

Anyway . . . enough philosophizing. The point of this post was these: links to the 'blogs I've been reading lately. Hopefully you know some of them already.
