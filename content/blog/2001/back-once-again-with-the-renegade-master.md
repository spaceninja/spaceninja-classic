Yarr, that's right, I've returned! Christmas was a blast. Annie and I went to Tacoma, and hung out with her family for awhile, then I went to Portland with my family for awhile, and then back to Tacoma for a week of network gaming fun with Annie's brothers and cousins! Hooray!

While in Portland, Steve and I hooked up with Miles and went to Chu's, and discussed our top-secret plans for Studio Fojar. Oh, and Miles got me the coolest geek gift ever, although I'm not sure he got it due to the geek qualities of it. He got me a ninja throwing star! It's totally cool, so I immediately hung it on the wall over my computer like the guy in Neuromancer did. It's a totally rad gift, and it made me feel like a complete ass for not getting him anything. But I'm making plans for a birthday gift. Oh ho! I will not be defeated! When did this turn into a contest? I don't know, but I'm going to win!

Network gaming was awesome as well. I think at one point we had 8 computers hooked together and 6 guys playing Quake 3. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, and I think we might do it again on the next break that everyone's home for.

I bought the expansion pack for the Sims, and discovered, to my dismay, that it doesn't work on Windows 2000, even though the regular game does! Solution: partition my hard drive and create a 98/2K dual boot, which I've been meaning to do anyways.

In the process of upgrading my machine's drivers to prepare for this, I was upgrading Annie's computer as well. While trying to flash the video card's BIOS to a new version, the computer crashed and now the video card doesn't give a signal to the monitor at all. Tech Support says all I have to do is put the card in a friend's computer (who has a different video card) and flash the bios again. I'm gonna get Urn to help me. "Come on, Urn, I doubt the same thing would happen twice! I'm sure your computer will be fine!"

Tomorrow, I return to work, sort of. We're starting the process of moving everything to the new location. More nerve-wracking than that, though, is the fact that Urn's and my first radio show is tomorrow night. I'm really nervous about it, and it doesn't help that Urn is nowhere to be found, so I don't know how prepared he is, or if he set up our first interview. :(
