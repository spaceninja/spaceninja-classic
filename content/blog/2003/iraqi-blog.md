Well, I didn't intend to post again so quickly, but right after posting that, I saw that [Sean](http://nyarlo.net/) linked to this guy's blog, who lives in Baghdad. He's doing a good job of trying to record a normal person's impressions from inside.

> A couple of hours earlier we were at a shop and a woman said as she was leaving, and this is a very common sentence, “we’ll see you tomorrow if good keeps us alive” – itha allah khalana taibeen – and the whole place just freezes. She laughed nervously and said she didn’t mean that, and we all laughed but these things start having a meaning beyond being figures of speech.
