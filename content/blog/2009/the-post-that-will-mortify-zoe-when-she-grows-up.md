These are the details that she'll kill me for sharing when she grows up, but I don't want to forget them, so apologies to future Zoe (and future me!)

Zoe is totally potty-trained now, and it was suspiciously easy. To the point where I'm half convinced that we'll wake up one morning to discover it was all a dream, or a cruel trick someone played on us. Basically, we just made sure the potty was available, and chatted it up, but didn't pressure her. Before we knew it, she was all about going potty BY HERSELF. Toddlers love any taste of independence, and once she figured out that she could sit on the potty instead of being put on a table and changed, she was all over it.

Of course, with that came the fascination with everything potty-related. She loves _Everybody Poops_, of course, but more than that, she wants to be involved when _we_ go potty. It makes sense, right? We're there when she goes potty, why wouldn't she be there when we do?

So with that comes many discussions about gender, body parts, and bodily functions. And, like most toddlers, the way she absorbs new information is to talk about it â€” endlessly. Which means that things sometimes pop up in unrelated conversations. Which is why the other day, I was informed that I was a "pretty nice guy" and that I had made a "fancy poop."

Lucky for Zoe, her cousin Milo is almost the same age as her. During a recent visit, they were both going potty (Potty Party!) and talking with each other about it, and I heard the following exchange from the next room:

> **Milo:** Zoe, Do you have a penis?
>
> **Zoe:** No, I have a NOT-Penis! I have 'GINA!
