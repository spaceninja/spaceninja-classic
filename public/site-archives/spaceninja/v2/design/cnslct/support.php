<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Computer Lab Support Provided by CNS-LCT</b></font>

<P><B>Hardware Installation</b>
<br>CNS-LCT will install additional hardware designated for use in the computer lab.  CNS-LCT reserves the right to specify system requirements and manufacturers of all hardware supported by CNS-LCT.

<p>Additional hardware may take two weeks or more to install depending on the level of complexity involved in the installation.  To request hardware installation; please use the <a href="http://www.cns.pdx.edu/action/">action form</a> link from our home page at www.cns.pdx.edu.

<p><b>Software Installation</b>
<br>All lab computers are rebuilt at least once per term.  Updates to the master build are done as needed throughout the term.  Labs may be rebuilt throughout the term as necessary.  

<p>Special software requests can also be accommodated.  Once a software request has been made through our web form (found by clicking on <a href="http://lct.cns.pdx.edu/current/softwarerequest/softreqcurrent.cfm">request software</a> from our homepage at www.cns.pdx.edu).  You must make arrangements to deliver the appropriate software media and licenses to SH134.  Software requests may take up to two weeks from the time we have all necessary media and licenses in hand.  All software requests expire at the end of the school year unless otherwise specified.  No software request may extend beyond one year from the date of the request.  If the requested software is required beyond the request expiration date, a new request must be filed.

<p>CNS is not responsible for purchasing software.  Software purchases are the responsibility of the party requesting the software.  CNS-LCT cannot install any software before a purchase order for the software has been created, unless the owner of the copyright provides the software to the general public free of charge.  No one outside of CNS may install software on any computer supported by CNS-LCT.

<p>Trial software will be installed a maximum of one time per term.  Trial software will be installed, only if the accompanying license states that it may be installed on multiple machines.  New trial versions of the same software will not be installed for more than one term, unless the license agreement explicitly states that this is permissible.  It is the software requestor's responsibility to provide the appropriate software to the tek team.  The Tek Team will not be responsible for downloading trial versions of software. We accept floppies, CDs and zip disks.  Since software is installed 14 days or more prior to term start, time-bombed software may expire before term end.
 
<p><b>Troubleshooting</b>
<br>Generally, but not always, technicians are available from 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Thursday, 8:00 
AM to 5:00 PM on Friday, and 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the weekends.  The entire staff of CNS-LCT consists of 
student employees.  Because of this, staff availability will vary.  If you have a technical problem, please fill out our <a href="http://www.cns.pdx.edu/action/">action form</a>, found by clicking on the link from our home page at www.cns.pdx.edu.  Our goal is to respond to all tickets and either fix the problem or have a hot swap machine in place within twenty-four hours of receiving a ticket.  Complex and network related problems may occasionally take longer than twenty-four hours to resolve.

<p>Emergency situations may occasionally arise.  In situations where an instructor needs something fixed in order to conduct class or of similar urgency, please submit a <a href="http://www.cns.pdx.edu/action/">ticket</a> and then call us immediately at 725-2600.

<p><b>Security</b>
<br>Physical security of the computer lab and its contents are the sole responsibility of the lab and its staff.  CNS-LCT will not be responsible for the physical security of the lab.  

<p>Both computer and network security are the responsibility of the CNS-LCT.  CNS-LCT grants local users write access to the c:\temp directory only.  Local users may read any file on the hard drive.  System settings, including display resolution, hardware devices, and network settings are not changeable by lab users or attendants.  Network access and restrictions are granted on a per user basis in accordance with Portland State University's general policy.

<p>Additional local rights may be granted to users on machines designated for use by lab attendants at the request of the lab manager or coordinator.  These additional rights are granted at the sole discretion of the CNS-LCT.  These additional rights can and will be revoked if abused or if they result in extra work for CNS-LCT.

<p><b>Cost of Service</b>
<br>CNS-LCT currently provides its services to Portland State University free of charge. The student technology fee currently funds these services.  Depending on availability and priority of the student tek fee, CNS reserves the right to recover the costs of providing these services in the future.  If necessary, these negotiations will take place between the department and OIT management.

<p><b>Service Extension</b>
<br>CNS-LCT reserves the right to negotiate extra budgetary compensation if it is asked to provide services to additional computers or locations.  CNS-LCT further reserves the right to negotiate additional budgetary compensation if asked to provide additional services to existing service areas.

<p><b>Lab Staff Responsibilities</b>
<br>The lab staff is responsible for general upkeep and maintenance of the computer lab and helping users utilize the resources in the lab.  This includes ensuring a clean environment for both the computers and the users.  The computers require a regular cleaning schedule.  CNS-LCT does not clean the computers, but can provide contact information for companies that specialize in cleaning electronics.

<p>The lab staff is responsible for answering general use questions, such as how to use the basic software packages, how to logon, and how to print.  The lab staff should be familiar with all equipment in the lab and able to resolve minor issues such as paper jams and toner replacements for the lab printer(s).  

<p><b>Support Provided by the Helpdesk</b>
<br>The <A HREF="http://www.helpdesk.pdx.edu/">Help Desk</a> provides critical support services for lab users, lab attendants, faculty, and staff. It also provides support for issues such as forgotten passwords and information on accessing campus computer resources.  The Help Desk should be called for all non-technical issues beyond the ability of the lab attendants and outside of the domain of CNS-LCT.  They can be reached by calling 725-HELP.
