[![Blog v4](/images/3118927226_bd36766091.jpg)](https://archives.spaceninja.com/blog/v4/)

I posted a new skin here called [Rustbucket](https://archives.spaceninja.com/blog/v4/). You can find it on the options page. I'm pretty fond of it, so I set it as the new default skin.

And while I'm talking about the site, let me take a moment to ask you all what you think of Rusted. What do you like and what do you dislike? I'm not really looking to change anything, but it would be nice to get some of your opinions.
