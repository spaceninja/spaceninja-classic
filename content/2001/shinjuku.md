Here's a badly pasted-together [panorama](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3727125225/) of Shinjuku, the world-reknowned "Demon City" of Tokyo. It's from high up so you can't see the freaky stuff . . . I'm not going to go take pictures of Kabuki-cho with this camera. It's big and obvious and the flash doesn't always stay off.
