Ugh. I'm so tired of job-hunting. I've applied for a ton of jobs, and been turned down for a ton of jobs. I applied for the webmaster position on campus, which would be perfect for me, and I'm totally qualified, but there's a few things that make me nervous that the job's already been filled. I'll find out in five weeks when the state gets done processing the application. It's ludicrous that I have to wait that long just to find out if the position is even still open. Maybe I should send an email to webmaster@cwu.edu and ask if the job's been filled...

Today I dropped off applications at Papa John's, Albertsons and Safeway. Annie also dropped off an application at Papa John's. The guy told us both to come back tomorrow at noon. With luck we'll get hired. I'm so tired of job hunting I'm willing to take anything at this point, just so I can stop being so worried about money all the time. I really really really really want the web job, but five weeks is too late. I need a job this week or we can't make rent in time. Best case scenario: I get hired at Papa John's immediately and quit when they tell me I'm hired for the webmaster position. That would be sweet. Less than best, I get hired at Papa John's and turned down for the webmaster. Worse than best, I get turned down in both places, and have to apply for a fast food job. I don't even want to think about what would happen if I got turned down for fast food.

AAAGH! God, I want to get that webmaster job! It's so sweet! I'm qualified! I can do it! I'm perfect! The pay's great, it's something I'm interested in, and I would do a great job!

I'm afraid I've already built up the job too much in my mind. I've been trying really hard not to, in case I get turned down, so I won't be crushed, but it may be too late. It's so perfect, and I want it so bad. I try not to let it affect my self esteem that after two months I still can't get a job and I'm down to applying at grocery stores and fast food, but it's hard.

One positive note, job-wise... Annie went by the bed and breakfast place to beg for a job today (didn't get one), and the woman told her she was looking for someone to design a webpage for her. I'm going by tomorrow. I'll try to get it as a paying gig, but if it looks like she won't give it to me, I'll do it for free just for the resume experience. All my sites now are for me or friends, except for the [CNS](http://www.cns.pdx.edu/) site. Need more professional stuff. It would be sweet if she would pay me to create a web site. It would make me feel like a real professional web designer. No more of this amateur crap, I'd be getting PAID to do what I love!

Tomorrow: Job Interview (?) at Papa John's, and try to get a web design job, plus our shift at the [radio station](http://www.881theburg.com/). Sunday: Breakfast Burritos, and Becky agreed to come over! Woo Hoo!

Side Note: We were watching the Simpsons tonight, and we got to hear Marge scream "SHUT UP BECKY!" Urn and I need to get a sample of that, and play it around Becky... _\*grin\*_

Other Side Note: rented _High Fidelity_ with Urn and Kat again tonight. Awesome movie.

Other Other Side Note: Kat makes good brownies.
