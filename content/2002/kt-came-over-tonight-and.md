KT came over tonight and we played an exciting game of "try to get the mouse out of the couch!" ...While we were watching TV, this mouse ran into the living room, and behind the TV, and then ran under the couch, where it got up in the folds of the mattress (but doesn't seem to have burrowed inside them, thankfully). After we finally scared it out of the couch (with our brilliant plan to get it to run into a bag, which it deftly avoided), it ran into the bedroom, where we think it ran inside the boxspring of the bed that Annie got from her friend last week. So I just came back from smearing some peanut butter onto the mouse traps we just bought, and with any luck, in a few days I'll have a dead mouse to carry out to the garbage.
