[![Sarah Palin - Nope](/images/2961989116_be754ff7d5.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2961989116/)

This was the image used on the cover of the most recent issue of the [Willamette Week](http://wweek.com/editorial/2008/10/15/ww-voters-guide-november-2008/). The original image was done by [Barry Stock](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bigleaftropicals/2842653337/), and is a suprisingly good parody of the Shepard Fairey "Hope" poster. The fact that this can run on the front page here in Portland makes me very happy.
