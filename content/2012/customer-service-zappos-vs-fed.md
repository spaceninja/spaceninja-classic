Recently, I had to spend some time in the customer support channels for two very different organizations: [Zappos.com](http://zappos.com/) and the Federal Student Loan Servicing Center. The difference between these two, while sadly unsurprising, was still dramatic.

TL;DR: The federal government has an aggressively unhelpful approach to customer service, with the startling combination of a website that doesn't do what it claims, an automated phone tree that tends to drop your call after ten minutes on hold, and disinterested support agents. Unsurprisingly, Zappos is much better.

## Zappos

I was calling Zappos because I had recently ordered two pairs of shoes, and I needed to return them both for different reasons. The New Balance shoes I bought were great, but the sole came unglued after a day of wear. I just wanted to return them for another pair of the same. The Vans, on the other hand, were phenomenally uncomfortable, and even after wearing them for a week to break them in, it became clear that I could not wear these shoes. Now, Zappos has a famously great return policy, but it says the shoes must be unworn.

I went to the website, clicked on "My Account," and was shown a list of my recent orders. I opened the more recent one, and was actually shown a large button to print a return label. I didn't think that would work, though, so I clicked on "Help" and found the customer service phone number. After a short trip through a phone tree, I had perhaps a five minute wait, and then a very friendly customer service rep took my call. She identified me as a VIP customer (strange, since I've only placed one other order with Zappos, over a year ago, but I wasn't going to argue with her), and asked how she could help. I explained my situation, and she said she would have a new pair of the New Balances at my house by tomorrow, and that while normally the return policy requires the shoes be unworn, she could make an exception this time. She emailed me the prepaid UPS labels to return the shoes, issued me store credit for the Vans, and I was done!

## Student Loans: Finding the website

Next, I needed to get a forbearance on my student loans. I graduated over ten years ago, but my wife is transitioning to a new career, and we needed to not make payments for awhile. I've done this before, and I know that what I'm looking for is called a "financial hardship forbearance." Each time I've applied for one before, I've called a customer service rep, who ultimately pointed me to a downloadable PDF from the website that I have to fill out and fax in.

First thing, I google for "federal direct loan servicing center," which points me to [www.direct.ed.gov/student.html](http://www.direct.ed.gov/student.html), which sounds familiar. I click through, and find a link in the sidebar for "Deferment and Forbearance." However, this turns out to be an informational page. Looking around, I can't find any way to log in, and conclude that I'm on the wrong site.

I search in my email for the keyword "loans," and stumble on a mail the servicing center sent earlier this year, which explains that they are moving to a new website, and the old address [www.dl.ed.gov](http://www.dl.ed.gov) (that's the one I remembered!) will be redirected to the new site: [www.myedaccount.com](http://www.myedaccount.com). It also says my old login won't work, and I'll have to create a new account.

## Student Loans: Using the website

Clicking through, I find a site completely unlike the old one (not a bad thing, since the old site was horrible, but still means I have to get my bearings). Looking around for a "register" or "sign up" link, all I can find is a "log in" button. On that page, I find the "register for a new account" link buried under the login form.

The signup process is simple enough, and after a few minutes, I'm on what appears to be a "my account" screen, with my loans displayed. In the sidebar, I see "Postpone My Payment (Deferment/Forbearance)," so I click on that, and see the following error message: "We are not able to evaluate your eligibility for a deferment or forbearance on-line. Please contact us to discuss your payment options."

## Student Loans: Phone support

I click through to the contact page, looking for a phone number. There are three listed: one for technical support (red print reads: Login Problems: Technical Problems Only!), one for Direct Loan Servicing, and one for Direct Loan Consolidation. I grab the number for servicing, and make the call.

Immediately, a recorded message tells me that if I'm calling for information about my account, I should check out their new website. This is followed by a recorded message that they are experiencing a higher call volume than usual. Then it hangs up on me.

Annoyed, I redial, wait through the two messages again, and this time am placed in a hold queue. After a minute, a recorded message comes on that says "for immediate service, press one." Immediate service sounds pretty good, so I press one -- and am connected back to the first two messages. I wait, again, and get back in the queue. This time when that message comes up again, I listen a little closer, and it says "for automated service," not "immediate." I stay on the line. Every two minutes, a robot tells me that they are experiencing higher than usual call volume, and my current wait time. It gradually declines from 9 minutes to 2 minutes, and then I get disconnected again.

## Student Loans: Email support

Frustrated, I get back on the website and look for an email option. On the contact page, I find a link to a support email form. I fill it out, and press the submit button... and nothing happens. Rather, the page reloads, but there is no success or error message. Shrugging, I give up.

Later, when I check my email, I have an automated email from Direct Loan Email Support, which lets me know they are experiencing higher than usual volumes of email, and they will respond soon. In the meantime, did I know they have a website? And on the website (which you'll need a new account for!) I can apply for a deferment or forbearance online?

The next day, I get another email, which tells me I have a message from the Direct Loan Servicing Center, and asks me to log into the website to see it. I click the "click here" link, and instead of opening the website, a PDF of the forbearance application form downloads. That's a little weird, but I'm not going to complain about getting what I needed, so I open the PDF. It looks right, and has my information in it, but random characters are scrambled. I assume because I'm on a mac, and they used some crazy proprietary font to generate their document.

## Student Loans: Fax support

I print it, fill it out, and fax it to the number provided. A week passes, and I hear nothing, so this morning, after getting off the phone with Zappos, I tried the customer service number again. This time I only got disconnected twice. The third time, the phone tree got stuck on a message about my account balance. No matter what button I pressed, it just repeated the same message. Frustrated, I pressed the zero button seven times in a row -- happily, the system took this to mean that I didn't know how to work my phone, and put me in the hold queue for a human support agent, which is what I wanted in the first place.

## Student Loans: Back to phone support

The woman who answered after 10 minutes of hold music spoke so quickly I had trouble understanding her. She did not say "hello" or "my name is" or any sort of greeting, just demanded my social security number. I provided it, and was asked, in rapid-fire manner, for my address, phone number, birthday and zip code. After all this, she asked what I needed help with. I explained that I was calling to check on a forbearance application I faxed in a week ago.

"I have no record of that," she said. Let me see if you qualify for anything better, and before I had a chance to protest, she launched into her rapid-fire question list, this time about my income and family situation. After a few minutes of that, she said I qualify for a financial hardship forbearance, and do I understand that means interest will continue to grow on my account? I said yes, and she said that I was good to go. "Okay, I don't need to send anything in or do anything more? I'm now in forbearance?" She said yes.

As I said at the beginning, the dramatic gulf in customer service quality between these two organizations is not surprising in the least, but it was still depressing.
