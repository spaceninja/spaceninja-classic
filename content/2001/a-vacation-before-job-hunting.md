Once I got to Portland, I decided to allow myself a vacation before I start seriously job hunting. It's been pretty nice, just goofing off all day. I've been staying up until 2 in the morning and getting up at Noon. My days have consisted of nothing but reading comic books I borrowed from my brother Sean and playing computer games. Since I can't afford a new game right now, I borrowed Sean's copy of Fallout, an RPG based in a post-apocalyptic future. It's a surprisingly cool game considering it's not very new, and I've just about beaten it, which is good, since I'm completely bankrupt. As much as I hate job-hunting, I hate not having money even more, so here I go! Wish me luck finding that perfect web design job, or at least avoiding McDonald's.
