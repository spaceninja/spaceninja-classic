The very first thing anyone ever said about our daughter was that "she's got a mind of her own!" That was the ultrasound technician, back when Zoe was still in the womb, but it's just as true today. No matter what we're doing, she'll find a way to put her own spin on it. Here she is at a friend's birthday party. This being only the second or third cupcake she's ever seen in her life, she was unsure how to approach it, and finally opted to grab it from the top, and eat the bottom first. A bit messy, but hey, to each her own.
