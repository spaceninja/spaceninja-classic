Too hot to type long sentences. You get summary-style posting instead.

1. 95 degrees is too hot to work. Which means I need to get up earlier to work while it's still cool. I am not happy about this development at all.

2. [Leilani's first big smile](/images/blog-photos/leilani_smile.jpg)

3. [New Hammerspace!](/site-archives/hammerspace/v2/) Yes, a second one! Inspiration hit me and I had to produce it. This one is a musical.
