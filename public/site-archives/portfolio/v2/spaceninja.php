<p>When I first started doing web design, I needed a name to operate under. Together with a friend, I chose the name Space Ninja design, combining two of our favorite things. The logo naturally needed to reflect both space and ninjas. The final design includes ninja weaponry with an alien head, all enclosed in a circle to represent an astronaut's bubble helmet. Additionally, the layout of the head and weaponry is meant to reflect the way martial-arts dojos display weaponry on the walls.</p>
