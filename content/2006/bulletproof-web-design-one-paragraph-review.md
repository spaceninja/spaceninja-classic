[![Bulletproof Web Design by Dan Cedarholm](/images/298401105_0cffe0e131_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298401105/)Having already written a book introducing readers to the web standards movement, Dan Cedarholm returns to cover more advanced material. While his first focused on markup and basic scenarios like grocery lists, this book focuses on CSS and accessibility. In particular, he explores how to let a web page flex around things like large font sizes or lengthy headlines without breaking - hence, bulletproof. While this material is all certainly all available online, this is a handy reference to some of the best practices and techniques that the gurus in the field have been using, and I would recommend it to anyone who feels like they understand the basics, but need a little boost to get to the next level. (_If this book were a college course, it would be 300 level._)
