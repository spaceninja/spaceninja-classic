Ha Ha! I am a customizin' man! Behold the screenshot of how smooth my system looks! Behold the transparent desktop icon text! Marvel at my custom start menu icons and button! Observe the classy color scheme and sweet Soviet-style font! Even my ICQ icons are set to my sweet desktop scheme! (I won't brag about the wallpaper, since it's bad form to brag, but I will [link](http://spaceninja.com/site-archives/yellow5/v2/free.html) to it).

But all of this pales beneath the glory of my newest discovery: Check out the background color of the explorer windows. Notice that they're not white? Well, any idiot can open up desktop properties and change the color, but it won't affect the web view on the left side! It's still white! And it looks tacky! Well, since I use the web view to preview images, I found out how to get make the web view use the correct background color. It's a pain, since Windows has started using special files to set that stuff, but it's all written in HTML, so I found out how to hack them! Boo-Ha! I rock!
