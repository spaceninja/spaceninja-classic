I had a post written up about my misadventures with Steve last night, but as I was about to post it this morning, Sean turned on the news. It doesn't seem appropriate now, so I will just tell you this.

- Ryan emailed us, he's at his girlfriend's apartment in Manhattan, and they're both fine.
- Steve told me that he heard from Stephanie, and that she and her family are fine.
- If you can, you should go donate blood.
