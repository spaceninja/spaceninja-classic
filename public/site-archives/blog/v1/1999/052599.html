<P>5.25.99
<BR>Sorry it's been awhile since I wrote, things have gotten pretty hectic around here. I'll try to give you a nice complete picture of my life right now. Where should I start... how about Annie...

<P>Things with Annie are fantastic. I'm so completely in love with her that it feels kinda strange. I guess I beleived in the idea of soulmates and love at first sight and stuff, but I never really thought it would happen to me. We're coming up on our one-year anniversary. I'm such a total gemini that I've only ever made it to one year once before, with my first girlfriend, who I only stayed with because I didn't know any better. Jill and I broke up the day before our one-year anniversary, but with Annie, it's different. It doesn't FEEL like we've been together for a year. Usually by this far into the relationship, I'm already bored, and the newness and excitement has worn off. Not with Annie. Things still feel new and exciting and I have so much fun with her! It's just great.

<P>What else is going on... Um, I just got a new computer sort of. I bought a new processor and motherboard, and then stole all the other components from my old computer, so it's really just an upgrade, but it's a large enough upgrade that it feels like a new computer. It's not working yet, but hopefully I'll get it running within the week.

<P>Speaking of computers, my design opportunities are coming along really well. Once I decided that I wanted to focus on web design, and I put up the website announcing my web design "company," things have steadily been trickling in. I'm about to rework the whole thing and change the company to Space Ninja Web Design, which is going to work together with my friend Miles, who's going to start operating under the name of Space Ninja Software. I'm going to get the domain name and then put up the website for us, and then we're going to work on a Giant Robot Fighting Game together (Giant Robot Fighting Game is really fun to say) over the summer. I also managed to get involved with another guy Miles and I work with, named Dennis, who is trying to start a Virtual Mall project and brought me on a Chief Graphical Advisor or something like that that sounded really cool. I'm excited about all these projects and I think I'll get good experience and portfolio pieces out of them all.

<P>I'm behind in my classes, which sucks, but the term is almost over, and I know that I'll get caught up. It might take a few all-nighters, but nothing new there. I do this every term and every term I survive. I'm less convinced now that I needed a design education. I'm not ready to dismiss it completely, because I do gain some things from it, including learning the ways I don't want to do things. However, the main reason I'm still in school at all right now is not because I need it, but because I want to finish what I started and get my degree.

<P>The end of the term is more stressful than usual right now, because in addition to juggling all the usual stuff, I'm also trying to plan a move. Come mid/late June, I'm hoping to move out of the Ondine and get a one-bedroom apartment with Annie somewhere downtown. That means my rent will double, but I'll be out of the Ondine, I'll have a bigger place, I'll get to share it with my girlfriend, and I won't have to share my bathroom and kitchen with the neighbors, as well as having a full-size kitchen. Annie's taking a year off school to live with me in Portland, but she's going to work at Americorp while she's here, which will get her experience and let her take some time off school. Then, when I graduate next summer, I'm going to move back up to Ellensburg with her so that she can finish her last year of school. Then we're going to Europe, and after that, who knows. We'll probably settle down and get jobs, while I refine my plans to take over the world.

<P>My birthday's in a week. I'll be 21. Unfortunately, it's on a Tuesday, so no bar-hopping birthday night for me. I can't afford to skip classes during dead week. But that weekend I should be able to go out. I've got a few friends trying to convince me to go to bars with them. I think I will, even though I don't think I like bars... I'd rather get together with some friends at home and drink, if I'm going to.

<P>Well, that's about all I have to say for right now... I'll talk to you later...
