Holy.

Living.

Crap.

Sean told me about this, but I just found the link to Sony's [total overhaul](http://www.us.playstation.com/pressreleases.aspx?id=227) of the PS2 design, ala the PSOne.

Apparently, after four years where only one game has ever made use of the "expansion bay" that takes up so much space in the original design, they've decided that no one else is going to use a hard drive, and they could just slim the thing down.

Down to, like, nothing. That's sweet.

And just in time, too, as my ps2 is on its last legs. Of course, it might just feel that way because I've been using Sean's X-box.
