yuk... 80s music sucks. But I can't wait until they have a "best of the 90s" station. I'll probably hate it, because they'll be playing the pop crap and not the 90s music I actually like, but it'll still be cool just for the novelty value of an "oldies" station that plays music I grew up with.

Sometimes I think I'd make a really good DJ. Other times I decide that I really really hate DJs and I would just broadcast music, with no speaking. Then I realized that I could do that with a shoutcast stream, but I never got around to it. Maybe I'll do one this summer.

The concept of being a DJ is cool. I will share really good music with people! None of this popular crap that they can hear anywhere... But the problem is that about 50% of the stuff I would play, they COULD hear anywhere... Right now a short excerpt from my playlist would look like this:

- queen - crazy little thing called love
- stardust - music sounds better with you
- pet of the future - solar cascade
- kruder and dorfmeister - bug powder dust remix
- massive attack - teardrop
- hooverphonic - renaissance affair
- roni size - mars
- new order - confusion (pump panel reconstruction mix)
- red elvises - 200 flying girls
- underworld - moaner
- orbital - satan (live in central park)
- portishead - wandering star
- beth orton - central reservation (then again remix)

That ought to be about an hour long.

...actually, now that I look at it, I think that would be a rad broadcast. There's a lot less popular stuff in there than I thought. I've got a (much longer) version of this playlist queued up at work right now, and I'm sure my coworkers are all sick of it, but I enjoy it.

Now the trick is to find a radio station that would let me play whatever I want and not force me to stick to the station's playlist.

Maybe I will start that shoutcast stream this summer...

**Edit - 9/8/2008:** This post is fun to read given that just a year later, I was working at a college radio station playing most of the songs on this list. It was awesome.
