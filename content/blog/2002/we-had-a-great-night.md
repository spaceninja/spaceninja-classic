We had a great night last night. Zach came over along with Alex and Garret from the Braindead Monkeys, and Miles and his friend Quentin were there, and Sean came over around midnight. We ate BLTs, played X-box, and watched a movie where Sammo Hung fights zombies. I spent a good deal of time drooling over the monkeys' [titanium ibooks](http://www.apple.com/ibook/). I made a new [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) (only noteworthy because of how infrequently this happens), and everyone left around 4 or 5 this morning. I love our Saturday night parties.
