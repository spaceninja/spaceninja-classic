We had snow yesterday morning, but over the course of the day, it all melted in the rain. None of the weather forcasts predicted snow on the valley floor, so we weren't expecting to wake up to heavy snowing. Appearently, no one else was either. We can see on the news cars at a standstill on I-84 and people walking around irritated. The news are operating with their backup morning crew, who aren't used to being on the air, so they're all saying "um, uh" a lot, and making nervous jokes. One woman actually appears to have a cold, and keeps coughing on camera.

And we just got a call from Annie's boss saying that they might close the mall today, so she shouldn't come in until she hears for sure the mall is open.

It's days like this that I **love** working from home!
