[![My desk at Pop Art](/images/IMG_0656.JPG)](http://www.spaceninja.local/gallery/index.php?album=pop-art)

Now that I've finally got my work setup all hooked up and working, I figured I should post a photo or two for anyone interested. Just click on the photo above to go to the [popart folder in my photo gallery](http://www.spaceninja.local/gallery/index.php?album=pop-art).

On my desk are two Dell LCD monitors, one of which is hooked up to a new Dell, and the other is hooked up to the mac mini you can see on the desk between the two monitors. There's only one keyboard and mouse on the desk, hooked up to the mac, and I'm controlling the PC using a program called Synergy, which [treats my mac/pc setup as a dual-monitor system](http://lifehacker.com/software/productivity/how-to-turn-your-dualmonitor-pc-into-a-dual-macpc-system-106123.php). I've got some new books that I'm working my way through. Several are by web standards guys like Dan Cedarholm, but one of them is _Beginning ASP.NET 2.0_, which my boss is [encouraging me to learn](http://scott.staging.popart.com/2006/04/12/ASPnet+Training+Exercises++Chapter+One.aspx). There are only two toy robots on my desk - I'm waiting until we move to the new office space in a few months to bring in the rest of them.

Directly behind my desk is my department manager, and to my left are my coworkers in the programming department. Further behind me, on the other side of my boss's desk is the design team's area. Sitting directly in front of me is the company president, which would be really nerve-wracking if he wasn't A) really nice, and B) frequently in meetings or on the phone.
