                <br><b>Scott 2000</b>: Okay, the biography section. What should we put here? We've got the <a href="stats.html">vital stats</a>, the <a href="thing.html">thing</a> KT wrote for me and I want to put up the <a href="thing2.html">other thing</a> Pat wrote for me. I wish more of my friends had written something, but oh well.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: We could write that author's bio thing you were talking about!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: No, it would look stupid plugged in here between us talking.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Yeah, I guess so. How about one of those email lists that people send around with that big list of questions about what you like?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: No, we already did that back in '98.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Hmmmâ€¦ What's the next century like?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Well, first off, it's not the next century yet. The 21st century doesn't start until 2001, since there was no year 0. But other than that, it's pretty much the same as things always have been. Computers are faster, cars are just as stupid looking. About the only thing I remember people saying we'd have by year 2000 that we actually do have are electric cars. They're unpopular and pretty rare, but Honda started selling one on the market this year.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: That sucks.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Well, it's kinda unrealistic to expect the world to change drastically overnight. Sure, lots of stuff has changed, but it's still the same world with the same problems in it. Oh, and all the "millennium" new years celebrations sucked.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Really? I would have thought there would be huge parties everywhere!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: The city of Portland blocked off five blocks around Pioneer Square to have a big party, and the police were out in riot gear just in case. I went with some friends and we shoved our way into this amazingly packed crowd down to the square the center of the action, only to discover that nothing was going on. There was a huge camera pointed at the crowd and everyone cheered when it came by, but it was cold and raining and when they put on the video about famous historical Oregonians, we went home to drink.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: You drink? But that's one of the things I'm proud of! I don't do drugs and I don't drink.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Oh, I still don't do drugs. But you get over the drinking thing once you move out of Mom and Dad's house. Don't worry, though, I still can't stand the taste of beer. I stick to hard alcohol, mostly vodka, and I don't drink that often.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Wow. That's still quite a change.

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Well, I've been through a lot of stuff since I was your age. I'm a different person. I remember Steve and I having a discussion about how much we hated high school, but that what we hated most was the way we acted. We agreed that if we ever went back in time, we'd punch ourselves in the gut, first thing.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: But that doesn't make any sense! Without the experiences I'm having, you wouldn't grow into the person you've become! You have to be me to be OOF!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Boy, I deserved that! Get up off the floor and help with the next section.
