there's something unique about the nature of waking up in a pool of your own vomit. i don't think it's possible to understand the true indignity of it unless it's happened to you.

we all joke about it, but i don't know if we ever knew what it was like to take a shower afterward and have to gently moisten up the crust in your hair so it doesn't hurt when you lather it up with shampoo.

or what it's like to have to stand under the showerhead with your ear pointed up to it, so the water flows into your ear canal and all around the contours of your outer ear, to soften the dried-on goo, and then scrape away at it with a bar of soap until it doesn't feel bumpy anymore.
