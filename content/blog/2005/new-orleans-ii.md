As if the immediate effects of flooding and debris weren't bad enough, think about the fact that every single building in the entire city will need to be inspected for damage, since every building has been touched by flooding and hurricane winds. Authorities are saying that it could take as much as four months just to pump the water out of the city. I can't even imagine this. A city this large, just wiped off the map, with all of the residents being forced to relocate. The Superdome refugees are supposed to be relocated - to Houston. Just think about that for a second - the easiest plan for everyone was to move 20,000+ refugees in busses across state lines.

Then think about the survivors. Months will pass before they can come back, and who knows what has happened to their possessions and homes, and it's almost certain that they will be unemployed since most businesses will have been destroyed as well.

On the news last night, the reported that automakers have announced a 90-day grace period for residents of NO on their car payments. Now, that's great, and it's good they're thinking of it... but imagine how quickly 90 days will pass when you're unemployed and homeless. Plus, most of those people, I'm sure, lost their cars in the storm.

Imagine a disaster so complete that it's easier just to go to another city and start again from scratch, with nothing. It certainly puts any difficulties that Annie and I have experienced into perspective, and makes me thankful for what we have.
