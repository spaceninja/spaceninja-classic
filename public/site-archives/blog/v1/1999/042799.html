<P>Man, what a great weekend!! Everything's just been going my way! Friday started out great� I slept in, went to my team meeting for work, ate pizza, and then we got out of the meeting early to go to the Tek Fair! I headed up there to see what there was to see, since Mark wanted us all to go (who am I to argue when my boss suggests I go to a fair instead of work?). I immediately found Steve, and we proceeded to have a blast. He had his digital camera with him, so I got him to take a photo of me with a beard so I can add it to my photo gallery (which I will do soon). We got mouse pads made of the printer in the Tek office that displayed !!!FUCK YOU!!! on it's readout (no joke! They're still not sure how it happened, but Steve and I got photos to prove it). Then I headed back to work and got some stuff I've been meaning to get done finished before Miles and I headed off to movie night. Mark showed <I>A Bug's Life</I> and <I>Ants</I>. If you haven't seen those movies, you're missing out. Steve and I had both seens <I>A Bug's Life</I> before, and spent the entire movie imitating the foreign acrobat pototo bugs. Up? Up! UP! HEY! � You're Fired! HAHAHAHA! After the movie ended, Miles and I headed back to the labs to play some games, and after we'd been there for about ten minutes, the phone rang. It was Aaron, wanting to be let into the labs, which I thought was kinda strange since the door by the Tek Office was unlocked, and after going back and forth for a few seconds about whether or not I should come open the door for him, I finally went to do so and was pleasantly surprised to find Annie standing there! I had spoken to her the night before, and she had told me she was all excited because she had met a few cool girl friends and they were all going bra shopping the next day. She didn't tell me that they were going bra shopping in PORTLAND. Needless to say, I bailed on gaming with Miles (he seemed to understand) and headed home for a lovely evening with my seldom-seen girlfriend. She was only staying the night, and her friends were picking her up at 1pm the next day, but that was actually cool, because Steve and I already had plans. At 1, her friends still weren't there, so we lay down on the couch to wait and listen to music and ended up having a nap together. Hmmm� I just read that sentence, and it sounds dumb, but trust me, that nap was cool. I think because we only see each other every two or three weeks, we tend to spend every second together DOING something. We never have any slack time to just relax and just be around each other, so it was cool to just have some time to crash together. Anyways, her friends arrived at 3pm, and I headed down to the Tek Office, where I met up with Steve and Angelko. Angelko's another guy on the Tek Team, but he just got a job at another company, so Shem (the Tek Boss) was throwing a party for him that night, which Steve invited me to. The three of us hitched a ride with another guy I didn't know and we had a great time at the party. Steve and I continued to pretend to be the potato bugs, although most of the people at the party just looked at us blankly as we punctuated every conversation we had with "You're Fired!" and "HEY!" followed by clapping and laughing. Highlights of the party: Angelko telling Steve and I about eels being eaten by geese, Steve ingesting a dab of Dave's Insanity Sauce (which caused him pain, followed by his face going numb), and Steve and I deeming the party inadequite (the party had split into two groups, one playing craps and the other debating philosophy. Steve and I decided to start our own party in a different room and wait for people to come to us, which happened! I swear, by the end of the party, no one was playing craps or debating philosophy, everyone was in our room!). About 2am, we all limped home, and crashed, only to find myself awakened at the obscene hour of 11am by my phone ringing. My study group for Art History wanted to meet, so I had to plan it before Steve and I were meeting to go to Fry's, which meant getting up right then. After that meeting, we hit Fry's and it was great! I traded in my STUPID STUPID non-functioning Diamond Monster Fusion card for a WONDERFUL, functioning Graphics Blaster Riva TNT card, which cost $50 less, so I could also buy some blank CDs and a new computer game! I also checked out prices, and discovered that I can have a new computer for under $300, so now I can't wait for my tax refund check to get here. That's about all that happened, and if I'm going to actually post this, rather than have it sit on my Work In Progress disk for a week, I'd better go.
