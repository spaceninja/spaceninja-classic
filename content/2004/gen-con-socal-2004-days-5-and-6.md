Not much to say about days 5 and 6 (also known as "Friday" and "Saturday"). These are the biggest days at the convention, and everything went smoothly. It's hard to gauge numbers, but the halls seemed full, and there were always several people in line, but never a huge line, which is good, because it indicates a steadly flow of moderate traffic, and our system handled it flawlessly.

Since things have been going so smoothly, I've spent the bulk of the last two days in the game lan playing World of Warcraft. I made fun of CJ for staying up all night playing it before he went to the airport after only getting an hour of sleep, but I can identify with that now. I stayed up until 5am playing last night, and observant readers will notice the timestamp on this entry is pretty late (early?) as well.

Anyways, tomorrow is the last day of the convention, and more stuff will be going on as a result. The game lan goes to free play at noon, which is good, because that will ensure that all of us are actually working and helping to break things down. Prior experience says that they'll start breaking stuff down as early as they can after registration actually closes, and we'll have a quick flurry of activity with the server and the regsystem, followed by an hour or two of downtime before the Dead Dog party - which will be strange this time, since nearly everyone is flying home Sunday night to be home for work on Monday, so most people won't be around for the party.

Oh well. Jeff and I don't fly out until monday, so I'll be able to have a few drinks and relax, and then try to amuse myself in the hotel room with my laptop and try not to fiend for WoW too badly.
