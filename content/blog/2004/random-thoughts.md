**I just saw Lisa Loeb and Dweezil Zappa** (who are a celebrity super-couple) performing together on the morning news\*, and was reminded of how adorable Lisa Loeb is . . . Dweezil was playing electric guitar and doing his rock-star son-of-Frank thing, and Lisa was playing her acoustic guitar, smiling and bobbing up and down, and at one point in the song she even whistles. This reminds me that I need to pick up Lisa Loeb (and Nine Stories)'s new album, which is a children's record.

**Also . . . President Bush's dog died?** The First Pet is dead and this is front-page news? _This_ is what's so friggin' important that it's the first story that pops up when I log onto AOL?\*\* No wonder so many Americans know nothing about foreign affairs . . . myself, sadly, included.

**And on the subject of the news,** Mel Gibson's new movie is about to hit theaters, so here are my top predictions for headlines you'll probably see way too many times in _the Passion of the Christ_ reviews:

1. Jesus Christ, Superstar _(if it's successful)_
2. The Last Temptation of Mel Gibson
3. The Greatest Story Ever Sold _(I've already seen this one)_
4. Jesus is Coming!
