i worked with a guy in his 50s tonight who had a new york accent. we talked for a while, and though the accent was the first thing i noticed, after a while i noticed a ton of mannerisms i hadn't seen since my last trip down long-island-way; mannerisms of the patriarch of the home where i spent my new york days, joey badagliacca's home. so i asked my coworker, on a hunch, where he was from. yep, new york state! haha.. he could've been joey's best friend, the way they were so similar in their little quirks, the ways they delivered a story, etc.  
  
and i got to thinking.. what do us pacific northwesterners come off as to other people? all i could come up with is that we're something like the stereotyped german. dry sense of humor ("joke" ah ha.. ha.. ha. ha.) .. being "clever." a touch overly serious, a touch of general disregard for the old guard.  
  
what do y'all think?
