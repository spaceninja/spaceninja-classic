I found the website of a sweet comic-book style artist yesterday, and I thought I'd post it here for you all to enjoy. http://www.agent44.net/

Aside from that, nothing is going on. Annie and I are poor again, but it's a temporary situation, and it's going to work out better. I got a raise at work, and I'm now an official employee, which is great. The catch is that with that change comes a shift from weekly paychecks to monthly. Starting this month. So I just got a paycheck yesterday, and I won't be getting another one for 30 days. eep! Luckily, I think we're good to go in terms of bills and stuff, it just means we can't really go out at all this month.

That's lame, because I was getting used to making enough money to be able to go out every now and then without having to give up something else. Still, in a month, everything will be better, and I should be pulling in a little more money.
