Despite mix-ups on everyone's part, Zach and I managed to successfully meet at Cinema 21 and catch the anime _Metropolis_, which was nuts. I wasn't sure if the plot was pretty simple, and I understood it, or if the plot was amazingly rich and complex and missed out on all the references. Either way, it had some amazing scenery... huge art-deco style techonology with giant gears powering a radiation device designed to shoot the sun to kill robots (?).  
  
Afterwards, Zach and I went to a bar and had some suprisingly good cheeseburgers and talked about my other top-secret project, which involves getting Zach to help me turn some of my ideas into "music."  
  
Also, it's looking like Secret Project Sunday is going to start turning into a weekly thing where we all get together and eat a good meal and play together. We've been having a lot of fun (at least I have), so I will be quite happy if this turns into a regular thing.
