Friends, I have seen the light! After carefully reading a pamphlet given to me by a man at the bus station, I have been born again, and I am making changes in my life. I have renounced my wicked ways, and I have taken a vow of celibacy to atone for my former sins.

And as one who has seen the Truth, it is my duty to try to save my friends, who are on the path to damnation. I call on each of you to follow the one true path into the light.

**Miles**: Isn't it obvious that philosophy is just another tool of the Devil to trick you into renouncing the True Faith?

**Steve**: I know the pornographic website we ran together brings in a lot of money, but all the money in the world will not save you on Judgment Day!

**Urn and Pat**: As the best customers on our shameful website, your souls are in danger as well!

**KT, Annie, and Jester**: Stripping may pay the bills, but it is still a SIN and you will pay for it in the here-after.

**Alex**: Your girlfriend may not know that you've been wearing her underwear, but God does!

I'm sorry if that was painful for any of you, but it was necessary! Having seen the light, it is my duty to attempt to save you all from yourselves! It's not to late to change your wicked ways!
