Working this job has made me realize something. I used to think that the work I was doing would be the most important thing, and that I could deal with any workplace situation given that I was doing what I loved. I have since realize that is inherently wrong. While doing what I love can make any job more bearable, the real key to enjoying your work is the people you work with.

My job seems mundane and irritating because that's what the people I work with are like, even though I'm doing graphics production, which I love. On the other hand, I've had two jobs that I liked, even though they were just grunt work. There were moments when I was first working grocery that I really liked because the guy running the butcher shop and the guys in the deli were friends, and we all had fun together. The work sucked, but the people were cool. The job started sucking when we came under new management. Also, I would have to say that my favorite job I ever had was my stint at Egghead. Everyone who worked there was like-minded. We were all good friends, and hung out after work, even! This despite the fact that I was working retail, and it sucked, I loved the job for my coworkers.

The tech team job in Portland was also awesome at times because of a combination of people who were, for the most part, in the same mindset, and work that was, for the most part, what I enjoyed doing.

All of this brings me to the inescapable conclusion that if there's even a tiny chance that Studio Fojar could work, I will seize it. I cannot pass up my dream of doing what I love with people who share my mindset.
