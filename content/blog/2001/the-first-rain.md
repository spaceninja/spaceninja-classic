It's raining outside. I love rain. But more importantly, I love the first rain after summer. There's just something great about getting sick of the heat, and then opening your window and listening to the sound of the rain.

I've been feeling the itch lately. About once a year or so, I get an urge to redesign all my websites. If I'm really lucky, I end up getting a burst of inspiration at the same time, and I can produce some excellent new designs. At the moment, I've got a new idea for my homepage and portfolio, as well as some new skins for all the KillingMachines sites.

Annie's sick right now. She came down with some sort of nasty cold, and is home sick for the second day in a row. She does sound much better today than she did yesterday, so hopefully, she'll feel better tomorrow, when we've got a day trip to the beach planned with Steve and Stephanie.

Now, that's truly a Pacific Northwest experience: It's pouring down rain, so we're going to go to the beach, where it's also pouring down rain! People in Portland learn how to have fun in the rain, because if you wait for the rain to clear up, you'll be waiting a long time.

My friend Daniel Achterman once described the difference between Oregon beaches and California beaches to me. He said that on a California beach, you put on your swim trunks, wade in the ocean, and play frisbee. On an Oregon beach, you put on a windbreaker, go for a walk, and poke things with sticks.
