Ugh. I'm giving serious thought to abandoning [Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/) and moving to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). I've thought a lot about this in the past, and always avoided it because I have so much time invested in MT, not just in this blog, but in all the others I support.

Pros: (allegedly) Little or no problems with comment spam. Open-Source and active development. Free. (Since MT is no longer free, this is a major benefit, as my free version of MT will quickly become out-of-date and full of major security risks). PHP and MySQL based, which means I can hack things myself. Better template structures. Speed. More logical operation (none of this rebuilding file nonsense).

Cons: Reinvesting a large chunk of time into learning a new system. Investing an even larger chunk of time into converting all the existing MT installations to WP. Training family and friends how to use the new system.

It seems clear that the pros outweight the cons, but I'm really nervous about it.

Another option would be to upgrade to MT 3, which has a free version allowing one user and up to three websites. This would work for every blog I maintain except for this one and dysnomia, and I think I could convert this one to a single-user blog pretty easily, though I kinda like allowing others to post here, too.

I guess the first step should be installing WP somewhere and attempting to migrate. More on this as I decide what to do.
