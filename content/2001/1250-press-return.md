I just got back from Jill and Eric's house. Under pressure from me, with backup from Annie and Corey, they agreed to watch [Pi](http://www.pithemovie.com/). Needless to say, I came home ready to do cutting-edge things with my computer (though I will probably settle for posting here and making a new [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/)).

Jill and Eric didn't seem to get much out of it. After the movie ended, they both had that overwhelmed sort of "what-the-hell?" look in their eyes. I was amped, Annie was happy because she had finally figured out where all the samples on the Pi soundtrack came from, and Corey was asleep.

I'm starting to wonder if this is one of those movies that only appeals to geeks (and ultra-religious Jews). I know the first time Miles and Steve and I all saw it, we all walked out completely excited. We practically ran back to the computer lab, with Miles and Steve excitedly babbling at each other about programming.

There's just something about watching the main character build his own computer, and rack mount them by drilling holes through the motherboards and assembling his own tiny clean-room for his classified government prototype processor. It just gets you excited if you're a geek.
