[![CSS Mastery by Andy Budd](/images/298401106_a6a2b9eae4_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298401106/)In the introduction to this book, Andy Budd writes "There are an increasing number of CSS resources around, yet you only have to look at a CSS mailing list to see the same questions popping up time and again." In that sentence, he's neatly summarized this book. The material contained here is certainly available elsewhere, and will be nothing new to power users, but if you're looking for a handy compendium of fairly advanced techniques, you'll get a lot from this book. Particularly nice are the chapters explaining image replacement and multiple-column fluid layouts, as these methods are hotly debated online, and it can be difficult to find good information on which technique works best. Andy compiles the best methods here and allows you to see the benefits of each. (_If this book were a college course, it would be 200 level._)
