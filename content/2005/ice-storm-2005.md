We got the annual Ice Storm last night. I left for work this morning to find 1/4" of ice on everything. The Fremont Bridge was closed, there were cars on the side of the road everywhere, people were slipping and sliding around, and I only saw one other person wearing boots. Jason, who I work with, said he heard on the radio that from 9pm last night until noon today there were 200 accidents in the Portland Metro Area.

All further proof that we just freak out around here when the weather turns bad. When they get on the tv and say "Please, don't leave your house unless you have to" they mean it!

_Our watering cup still had some water in it as of last night._
