**current mood:** _productive_
**christmas lights:** _twinkling_
**current composer:** _mozart_

I had a rediculously good time last night watching _Kiki's Delivery Service_ for Miyazaki night. We were all in a goofy mood, and spent the whole time making fun of the movie. It was great.

I seem to spend a great deal of time watching movies and, to a lesser extent, television. I don't feel bad about this until I go to post here, and realize that nothing really worth talking about has happened except for some movies I saw. And I doubt people read this site for my movie reviews (though if you're interested, I liked the new Harry Potter).

Oh well. I'm definitely a movie person, watching movies is something I love doing, so I'm not going to beat myself up about (that's Annie's job). I've also been working on web stuff lately, but in terms of fascinating reading, the minutia of upgrading the software that runs this site must rank up there with watching paint dry.

I did start a new forum on KMorg yesterday: http://Soapy.KillingMachines.org/ ...It's a forum devoted to the (fictional) KillingMachines soap opera. I wrote up some basic characters and a first couple episodes. Hopefully other people will like the idea and keep the ball rolling. If this fails, I'll just have to go back to pressuring Sean to write more [Gary Dirin](/tags/gary-dirin/) stories.
