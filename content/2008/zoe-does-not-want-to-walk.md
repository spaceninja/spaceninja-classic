We'd been trying to get her to walk for a couple of minutes, and this is how she let us know she was done.

I posted a whole slew of videos and photos on flickr. I'll be highlighting a few of the best showing all of Zoe's new tricks this week, but if you don't want to wait, feel free to [check out the rest of them](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/archives/date-posted/2008/06/detail/) right now.
