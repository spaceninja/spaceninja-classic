I'll be honest here. I bought Doom 3 to kill time until Half Life 2 came out. I had just upgraded my computer so that I could play HL2, but it was still several months away, and I needed something to test out my new graphics card on. Doom just happened to come out at the right time.

That's not a say that I wasn't excited about it, but I was never all that into Doom. Back in the shareware-trading days, all of my buddies and I had similar computers and traded disks full of shareware back and forth. As a result, even though we didn't have enough money to afford the full versions, we played almost every game out there at one point or another.

The shooter genre was really started by Wolfenstein 3D, and was further popularized by Doom 1 and 2. But although I played Wolf3D and Doom, I was never really gung-ho about them. I was vaguely aware that there was a following for the game, just as I was vaguely aware that Doom had a multiplayer component (Something none of my friends and I could afford to take advantage of in the days of dial-up). At the time, I was much more interested in the "adventure" genre, and spent my time playing King Quest, Quest For Glory, Space Quest, and other games with the word Quest in the title. Later, when Quake came out, I began to see what everyone was so excited about - and it helped that I had access to computer labs where I could play multiplayer.

When the rumors of Doom 3 started spreading, the remake of Wolfenstein had just been released, and almost universally disappointed. Sure, it looked better than the original, but how could it not? What we got was an average-looking shooter to kill Nazis with. It had its moments, but added nothing to the genre. It was a completely forgettable game.

Now, given that Wolfenstein was older than Doom, and that I had never really played Doom the first time around, I didn't really understand the excitement and nostalgia that Doom 3 was generating in the game industry. I finally started to understand when I saw some screenshots of the game, and that's when I decided it would be a good game to test out my upgraded computer on.

What Doom 3 had going for it was **incredible** graphics. Where Wolfenstein simply updated an older game to modern standards, Doom was setting new standards. The game was going to be dark and creepy and dark and bloody and dark. Even the screenshots were mostly black - no one knew what to make of it.

When the game finally arrived, it was just as beautiful as promised. Moody orange lighting suffused every level. Everything looked dirty and rusty and neglected. The interiors felt like a submarine, and the claustrophobia added to the tension. But the gem in the graphics crown was definitely the organic bits. While people looked a bit rubbery, the alien bits glistened and quivered and twitched. Everything was disgustingly realist, and you constantly felt like you needed to wash your hands.

Unfortunately, Doom completely failed to deliver in any department other than graphics. The gameplay was not just disappointing, it was actually a step backwards. Most of the game took place indoors, and the rounded corners didn't conceal the fact that it was a dungeon crawl just like the first-gen shooters. You rarely had more than one option when choosing where to go, so the entire game felt like it was set on rails.

The monsters were horribly stupid, as well. Every monster in the game just makes a beeline straight for you. Plus, not only are zombies and demons hiding behind every door, they're hiding behind secret doors (one every 20 feet or so) and they can materialize out of thin air, in front and behind you. This means that unlike other modern shooters, where the opponents have to follow certain rules like not being able to pop through solid walls, you cannot really use any strategy in Doom. Open door, kill everything you see, check the room for power-ups, and move on to repeat the whole process in the next room.

One of the dumbest moments in the whole game comes from a closet zombie. Through suspension of disbelief, I was able (barely) to accept that Mars base was full of closets with doors that were designed to seamlessly mesh with the surrounding wall, and that when the base started filling up with demons and zombies, many of them decided that instead of killing based personnel or chasing my character around, they would just stand in a small closet for a few hours until someone accidentally opens the door. Also, these demons frequently had a small horde of ammo and armor with them. But like I said, I could (just barely) roll with this. The problem came when I triggered a closet, shot the demon inside it, and then stepped into the closet to pick up the powerups, only to trigger another closet, **contained within the first**, also with a demon inside it.

Because the monsters are so stupid, the lack of strategy, and the limited exploration options available, the game gets old fast. I forced myself to play through it because I paid full price for the game, and I wanted to make sure that it didn't magically get better later on.

Well, if you're doing the same thing, let me save you some time: It doesn't. Even after your character actually goes to "hell", weapons and ammunition are abundant. In fact, aside from the scenery, the only real difference between hell and the base is slightly larger monsters and the fact that you have an unlimited run meter. This is (poorly) explained as some side effect of being in another dimension, and serves to lessen the impact of being in hell.

As my brother and I remarked to each other, if this is hell, then what's everyone complaining about? All you need to get through it is a shotgun and a can-do attitude.

I'll refrain from complaining about the inability of your character to strap his flashlight onto his main weapon, since I understand that's a design decision, and I actually agree with it - It was one of the only things that kept the game creepy.

My largest complaint, however, is the "boss" monsters. Apparently, Id decided that they should make up for the unchallenging nature of the rest of the game by making the bosses impossibly difficult. I'm sure there are people out there with the patience and skill to defeat the bosses without having to reload constantly or use cheats, but I was not one of them. In general, I scorn the use of cheats, but after beating my head against one boss for a full week, it became clear that if I didn't cheat, I would eventually give up, and never finish the game.

The reason Doom 3 is so disappointing is precisely because it had so much potential. This was a game that could have been great. They lifted some nice details from other games, such as the PDAs with emails from other characters, but it seems like they never figured out how to use these details to tell a story. PDA emails are useless, except for gathering codes for locked cabinets all over the base (and yes, one of the locked cabinets has a demon inside it). Id has delivered to us beautiful engine that they use to tell a bland and uninteresting story.

There are rumors on the net that Id is working on the next Quake game, which will use the Doom 3 engine, and feature a single-player story again. With any luck, they will take the extra development time that gives them to focus on telling a story, rather than finding new hiding spots on the map to fill with monsters.
