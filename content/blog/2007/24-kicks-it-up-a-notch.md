Wow. Just, wow. I won't give anything away in case you haven't watched it yet, but suffice to say that 24 is doing their usual thing of taking everything they've done in the past and one-upping that in the first few episodes, leaving you absolutely floored, and wondering how they're going to top this. And it's only been four episodes. There are TWENTY more to come.

I mean, this is a show that should, by all rights, get worse each season as you realize they've already used up their whole bag of tricks. Instead, the show has been getting exponentially better with each passing season.

Plus, I **love** what they're doing with Jack this season, showing how the stress of the last few years has really just beaten him down.
