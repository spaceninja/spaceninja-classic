[![What Video Game Character Are You? I am a Thrust-ship.](/images/3.png)](http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl)I am **a Thrust-ship**.

I am small and tricky - where you think I am, I probably am not. I can work very fast, but I tend to go about things in a round about way, which often leaves me effectively standing still. I hate rocks. Bloody rocks.
