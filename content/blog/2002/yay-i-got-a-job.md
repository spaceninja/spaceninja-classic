yay!!!
I got a job, la la la la....
who would've thought I'd be excited about a mall job? there are many cool reasons why:

It's a toy store.

It's in an "upscale" mall, (Pioneer Place) as opposed to the "ghetto" outlet mall where I had my first job.

It's downtown, which means it won't cost me anything to get to work.

I get a big discount.

The people who hired me are awesome.

The store is an extension of an existing toy store, which means since it's going to be brand new, everyone's starting together.

I get to help set up the new store before it opens.

The hours are flexible, and other new people are students too, which means going to school in the fall won't be a huge issue.

oh, yeah, and one of the questions they asked me at my interview was to name 4 Jedi. :)

now maybe I can live up to my Hammerspace quote.

"Less angry, more smile."
