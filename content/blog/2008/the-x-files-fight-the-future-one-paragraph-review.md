Last night, KT and I rented the first X-Files movie so we could get caught up for the sequel. Given that it came out ten years ago, I wasn't sure how well it would hold up, but it was fun, and now I feel like I've got enough of the storyline back in my head that I'll be able to appreciate the sequel. Both KT and I remember being confused when we first watched the movie in the theater. This time, it was much clearer. ("Oh, _that's_ what they were doing with the bees!") The only things that took me out of the story were the size of their cell phones and getting used to the way they speak to each other again. Honestly, I had forgotten how much Mulder likes the sound of his own voice.

> **Scully:** _(impatience)_ Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data — if you ignore it as we have done — the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --

> **Scully:** Jesus, Mulder...

> **Mulder:** The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
