[![Scott's Enron logo on the front page of the New York Times business section.](/images/newyorktimes.jpg)](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/enron/newyorktimes.jpg)

If you pick up a copy of the Sunday New York Times from yesterday, you'll be able to see an illustration of mine on the front page of the business section! My [new rusted version of the Enron logo](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/enron/enron-rust-preview.jpg) was worked into a photomontage to accompany a [followup story about the company](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/20/business/yourmoney/20jail.html?ex=1290142800&en=0f2eaa581e8fe99e&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss). Sadly, I wasn't able to get credited for the work, due to red tape about the number of people involved in the final image, but I got permission to use it in my portfolio, and my work is in the paper, so I'm still counting it as a victory.

This whole thing was a total fluke. I got a phone call from a guy at the Times who was working on the story, and was doing a [google image search for Enron](http://images.google.com/images?q=enron), and stumbled across a link to my [old rusted version of the Enron Logo](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/enron/enron_spaceninja.jpg), which I had created for a [Viridian design contest](http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/251-300/00284_enron_logo_contest.html). Unfortunately, I had lost the source files, and even if I hadn't, I didn't have permission to use the rust photo-textures in the original in a commercial project. So I recreated the logo from scratch, and I think the [new version](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/enron/enron-rust-preview.jpg) looks even better. I handed the source files for the new version off to the Times, and they incorporated it into their photomontage to make it look like the Enron logo is made of prison bars.
