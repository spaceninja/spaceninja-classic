haha, OH MAN, i rule.

some coworker just walked in and said, "hey, steve, program X is broken." so i said, "you gotta grease the wheels!" he thought i meant money, so i corrected him, "give me liquor."

"that i can handle!" he said, and walked out!

a minute later, he returned with a huge bottle of crown royal and _gave me a swig_ to get his problem fixed!!

THIS JOB STILL HAS POTENTIAL
