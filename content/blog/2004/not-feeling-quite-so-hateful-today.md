I think maybe I need another category to post in... this isn't really a hateful post, but it's not about entertainment or web development either. Oh well.

Last night we came home from watching _Life of Brian_ at Eric and Jill's house to find that the mouse traps I set up earlier in the day had already caught one. Mice are retarded for peanut butter, appearently. Last time, I caught both mice within two days of setting the traps using peanut butter, and this time it was just a matter of hours.

Disposing of the body was horrible, as always, but there was the reassuring feeling that something had been done to combat the problem, and possibly solve it if we only had one mouse... though I'm leaving the traps up for a few weeks until I'm sure they won't catch anything else.

I really do feel better this morning, after a solid night's sleep, and eating my sun-dried tomato and basil bagel with sun-dried tomato hummus. It also helps that it's Friday.

I plan to spend the weekend relaxing, learning how to use my new camera, and playing Grand Theft Auto on my xbox.

I might even do some web design that I've been putting off (a page design for Sean, and of course the styles for this site as well).
