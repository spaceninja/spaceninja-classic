Remember what I said about not watching the new Matrix trailer if you were concerned about learning too much of the plot?

Well, the trailer for [Lord of the Rings: Return of the King](http://lordoftherings.net/index_rotk_trailer.html) is out, and the same does NOT apply. Go watch this right now, even if you've never read the books before. It gives nothing away, but succeeds very well in getting you amped about the movie!

...

Oh, and while we're talking about trailers, don't bother with the theatrical trailer for [Kill Bill](http://www.kill-bill.com/). It's got spoilers, and it's nowhere near as cool as the [teaser trailer](http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/kill_bill/).
