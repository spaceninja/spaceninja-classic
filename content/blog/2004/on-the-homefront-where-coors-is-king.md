Since Scott has taken his game playing to a computer far far away, I have had to feed myself for once... so after braving the lamest mall ever, I decided the other night to try a little local place in Sumner right off the train tracks called KC's caboose. Cute decor, lots of christmas lights, I'm the only one there who doesn't know the waitress's name, you get the idea...I was excited to see that they still have 99. cent coffee, but that probably speaks to the quality of it.

Anyway, since I'm obviously out on my own with my cell phone and a book, I decide to go for a solid meal of meatloaf and beer. This is the conversation that followed.

ME: Do you have any beer? Her (waitress): yeah Me: what kind? Her: you name it, we got it Me: ok, do you have Black Butte Porter? Her: Wha??? (looking really confused) Me: black bu....never mind, what do you have? Her: Coors, Coors Light, Heineken, Alaskan Amber, Pyramid, Mac n Jacks,....

Apparantly, "you name it, we got it" doesn't mean the same thing here that it does in P-Town. The last place that said that to me had like 80 beers available. I love that they had Mac n Jacks, but she was completely thrown by black butte...Man, I have to go remember what the local breweries are now....Black Butte is a staple! Gahhh...I know pyramid is local but I don't really like them...

That's it, I'm moving back. This is the last straw.
