Well, the new [hatelife](http://hatelife.org/) is done! It's using Steve's new forum software, called Forum5000. It doesn't have a website yet, so I can't link to it. I'll let Steve explain the details if he wants to, but basically, it's a leaner, meaner, more expandable version of FCS.  
  
Then, Steve decided that he wanted to upgrade hatelife to have a powerful CSS layout that didn't use any tables. He and I have spent the past week pulling together what is probably my best CSS work ever. The site is standards-complaint, and the code is smooth and deadly, and it would be incredibly easy to completely change the way the site looks purely through the usage of CSS (which I plan on doing when we put forum5K on KMorg). And best of all, I finally got to use the browser-upgrade trick I learned from [WaSP](http://webstandards.org/act/campaign/buc/tips.html)... so if you view hatelife using Netscape 4.7 (or any browser that doesn't support CSS2) then the stylesheet doesn't load, leaving you with a stripped-down (but functional) version of the site, and a link to upgrade your browser!
