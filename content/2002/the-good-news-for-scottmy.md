The good news (for scott):  
My [Linux](http://spaceninja.local/gallery/albums/blog-photos/snapshot1.png) box appears to be working! I had a 6GB drive that windows wouldn't touch, but Linux installed right onto it!  
  
The good news (for steve):  
The [cute little toaster computer](http://www.fojar.com/~steve/pics/tinycomputer.jpg) is working! I'm not sure if he had to reinstall Win2K, but I'm guessing he didn't have to, since he hasn't mentioned it.  
  
The bad news (for anyone who didn't back up their [fojar](http://www.fojar.com/) inbox):  
The hard drive with the mail on it was unrecoverable. Any mail that was saved outside of the "inbox" folder on fojar was saved, but everyone's inboxes were wiped. Of course, if you use an email client that stores your mail locally, this didn't affect you.  
  
The other good news:  
My copy of [Halo](http://www.bungie.net/perlbin/blam.pl?file=/site/1) is actually on the way! Turns out Fed Ex couldn't find my house (huh?) but I gave them a call, and found out the package is actually in Portland somewhere, and hopefully I'll get it soon!  
  
The other good news (for people who hate [Qwest](http://www.tsewq.com/home/default.asp)):  
Not only is [Qwest](http://www.google.com/search?q=fuck+qwest) getting investigated by the government for [questionable financial practices](http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/0404TECH-TELECOMS-QWEST-DC.html), They're in hot water here in Portland, too! [Willamette Week](http://www.wweek.com/flatfiles/news2658.lasso) is encouraging everyone to withhold the franchise fee that [Qwest](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=hate+qwest) passes on to us, since they're not paying it to the city, so why are we paying it to them? (Note, as tempting as it is to do something mean to [Qwest](http://www.fuckqwest.com/), I'm not going to do this. My [Qwest](http://www.tsewq.com/links/linklist.asp) status is tenuious enough as is without me tempting them to shut off my account by not paying a 35 cent fee).

**Edit 10/26/2005:** We no longer control the fojar domain, so any links pointing there are broken.
