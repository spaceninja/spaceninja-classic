We have a dining room table! Over the weekend, Annie went to Saturday Market with my parents and found an awesome dining room table with four chairs! It's a really attractive wood white trim, and it's just barely used (some tiny nicks and dings, but nothing that makes it look bad).  
  
The cool thing is that it totally completes our dining room. It was kind of a useless room before, because we didn't have anything in it (because we knew we'd be getting a table eventually). But now the room is awesome.  
  
And in other good news, KT found an apartment too!  
  
And in other good news, Zach had a good interview for the full-time, permanent version of the warehouse temp job he has now!  
  
And in other good news, it's my birthday on Saturday!
