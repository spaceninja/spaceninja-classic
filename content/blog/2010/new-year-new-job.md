In October, after four years at Pop Art, I decided it was time to move on. While I will always miss the incredible people I worked with, and the passion everyone brought to the job, the company had changed and it wasn't the right place for me anymore. While negotiating my exit, I interviewed for a job at R2C Group, which I accepted.

However, in my first week at R2C, it became clear to me very quickly that it was a poor fit. I spoke to my managers, and we all agreed to do everything we could to address the situation, but in the end the company's needs and my own were incompatible. I gave notice, and my last day was Christmas Eve. I didn't have another job lined up.

At that point, I had the bills for January paid, and the plan was to take a break through New Year's, and then come back and start freelancing until I found a new job. I was nervous, since we're a single-income family, but I had good agents at some placement agencies in town, who seemed sure they could get me work. I wasn't looking to freelance forever, but I was confident that I could keep the bills paid that way, until the right job came along. I was hoping that I would have that job within three months, though I was concerned it might be more like six.

Over the break, I lined up a few job interviews, including one at [Metal Toad Media](http://metaltoad.com/), a web development shop in downtown Portland who were looking for a front-end web developer, and had been referred to me by [Dave Selden](http://bsbrewing.com/) (thanks, Dave!). The job sounded good, but I tried not to get my hopes up. I mean, what are the odds that one of the first job offers to come my way would be worthwhile? My goal was to find the _right_ job, not take the first one I found.

On Monday, January 4th, I interviewed at Metal Toad, and I thought it went very well. The company seemed like a great fit, with a small team of passionate, dedicated developers, and they seemed to understand the value that I could provide as a specialist. When I went home that night, I was cautiously optimistic, but still trying to keep my expectations in check.

The next morning I had a job offer waiting for me, which I happily accepted. I started work on Wednesday, and so far, it's fantastic. The work is right up my alley, but still challenging (I'm learning how to theme Drupal), and my coworkers are a great bunch of geeks. It cracks me up that things worked out this way, since I was so mentally prepared for a long drawn-out job hunt, and here I seem to have the perfect job dropped in my lap on day one. I'm a lucky guy.
