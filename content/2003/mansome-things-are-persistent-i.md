man..some things are persistent!

i went to reregister hatelife (which actually expired, oops), and have about 30 domains somehow attached to me through joker now, either mine or someone else's, and right there at the top of the renewal page:

Hatelife.org   \[x\] Yes   \[ \] No
Aceeventservices   \[x\] Yes   \[ \] No
***Uisce.org***   \[ \] Yes   \[x\] No
