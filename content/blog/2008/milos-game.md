Milo and his parents are visiting us this week, so I thought I'd post this video of a game Milo was playing with Dave at the park a few weeks ago. Milo would pick up a handful of bark chips, and then chase Dave around trying to throw them on his shoes. When he threw them, he would walk back to the play structure, get another handful, and start over.
