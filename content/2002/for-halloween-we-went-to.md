For Halloween, we went to the [Kennedy School](http://www.mcmenamins.com/Kennedy/) to see the [Willamette Radio Workshop](http://www.radiowork.com/) put on a live radio play of [Dracula](http://www.radiowork.com/dracularprinter.html). It was an [Orson Welles adaptation](http://www.unknown.nu/mercury/), just like the [War of the Worlds radio play](http://www.genericradio.com/waroftheworlds.htm) Annie and I were involved in at the [radio station](http://www.881theburg.com/) (but much better). Most of the guys were [impressively large, with big beards and booming voices](http://www.radiowork.com/who.html). While they read through the parts on the script, they also had some sound effects guys making the sounds of horses, thunder, wolves, etc. The best part was when they hammered the stake through Dracula's heart, one of the guys actually hammered a wooden stake into a pumpkin.  
  
Miles enjoyed it enough that several hours later, he was still excited about the idea of us all doing a radio play for Secret Project Saturday, which I think would be great! When I told Miles that I knew of a [good site with lots of scripts](http://www.simplyscripts.com/radio2.html) he looked at me like I had spit on him, and said "Scripts??" ...So he probably wants us to do some Dangerman radio play... which wouldn't be a bad idea, except it requires that we write a script first, and I'm not sure any of us have the attention span to do that and then follow through on producing the play. Still, you never know... in a few weeks, I might be posting an mp3 of the [Dangerman vs. Navy](http://isometric.sixsided.org/_/dangerman_vs_the_navy/) radio play, by Studio Fojar!
