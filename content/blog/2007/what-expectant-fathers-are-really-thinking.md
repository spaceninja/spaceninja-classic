- Pride: See that belly? I did that. Virility Confirmed, etc.
- Finances: Wait, don't babies need cribs and hats and stuff? How are we paying for all this?
- Geek: I wonder if I can rig up some sort of camera system instead of a crappy baby monitor?
- Finances: Did she just buy more baby clothes? How many onesies does a baby need anyways? Maybe I'd better open that budget spreadsheet...
- Macho: What if someone tried to hurt the baby? I bet I could choke a good-sized guy if I needed to.
- Finances: No, seriously, who the fuck is paying for all this?
