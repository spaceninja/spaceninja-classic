**Yesterday:** Coworkers discussing a big client coming to the office, who is excited to see what kind of creative halloween costumes a web design firm comes up with. It is strongly implied that we should all dress up. Lots of talk about costumes. After work, I travel around the mall for a couple of hours and manage to piece together a pretty solid costume.

**Today:** I'm the only one wearing a costume. Figures.

Anyways, I'm wearing the [tank-top kind of workout gear](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/284754553/) that they wear on Galactica. The hardest part was finding a black tank top and a gray sleeveless shirt, but after hitting just about every store in the mall, and then Freddies, I managed to find both. Of course, I'm a little nervous about wearing a tight shirt with my er... physique, but I'm saying that I'm an out-of-shape Viper pilot. After all, I just spent a year on New Caprica getting fat. The old man would totally yell at me and make me go to sit-ups with Lee.
