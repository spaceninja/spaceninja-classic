Prepare yourself for another photo post! A week ago, we drove up North to attend Oskar's first birthday party, which was pirate themed, and then this weekend we went up again to see Zach's piano recital. I got some good photos at both, but the crown jewel here is video of **Oskar walking!**

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Pirate Ship Cake](/images/oskar/IMG_2872.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2872.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Rose made some incredible pirate ship cakes. They had full sails, little pirates, and even cannons firing out the sides!

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Up and At Them!](/images/oskar/IMG_2875.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2875.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Shortly after people started arriving, the birthday boy awoke and I managed to grab a photo of how happy he looked as he waited to be let out of his crib.

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Urn and Kat](/images/oskar/IMG_2878.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2878.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Urn and Kat arrived in piratical fashion, fully decked out in pirate gear (this was not their first pirate party), and were even kind enough to bring hats and knives for everyone else.

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Pirate Couch](/images/oskar/IMG_2880.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2880.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Oskar was sitting in my lap playing with a knife, and we tried to pose for a photo, but Oskar kept smiling at me instead of the camera.

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Opening presents with Dad](/images/oskar/IMG_2895.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2895.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Oskar was having a fine time a little later, though, opening all of his presents (with a little help from his dad).

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Too Slow, Dad!](/images/oskar/IMG_2893.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2893.jpg 'Photo Sharing') But when Dave was going too slow for him, Oskar was quick to ditch his old man and strike out in search of more presents.

[![Oskar's First Birthday - Buried in wrapping paper](/images/oskar/IMG_2901.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/oskar/IMG_2901.jpg 'Photo Sharing') By the end of the opening session, Oskar was barely visible under the pile of wrapping paper.

[![Zach The Pianist](/images/zachs-recital-sept2005/IMG_2926.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/zachs-recital-sept2005/IMG_2926.jpg 'Photo Sharing') After Zach finished his recital, I managed to grab this nice photo of him during his encore, when he played a really nice piece he wrote himself.

[![Keep Practicing, Grasshopper.](/images/zachs-recital-sept2005/IMG_2934.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/zachs-recital-sept2005/IMG_2934.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Not one to hoard the glory, however, Zach agreed to a duet with a quick learner.

[![Oskar Walking](/images/MVI_2936.jpg)](http://spaceninja.local/movies/oskar_walk.avi 'Photo Sharing') After the recital was over, I was lucky enough to get to help Oskar work on his walking. He was really excited, and would turn around from the chair and walk several step before hurling himself towards me. It's hard to say who was having a better time or laughing harder. **Warning!** This links to a large video file, not a photo. The video is **22.6 Megabytes** and will take forever to download if you don't have broadband - but it's definitely worth it if you do!
