My five-year anniversary of blogging is approaching, and I'm doing a lot of prepwork behind the scenes to get ready. I've already done a lot of code cleanup, and I'm getting ready for a redesign (which may or may not be done in time). I've just finished implimenting the plugin that lets me flag entries as noteworthy, which fits in with some of my larger goals to overhaul the archives and categories to make old entries easier to read. I'm also going to import my old KMorg and Hatelife entries, just to consolidate all my online personas over the years. I admit, I'm being heavily inspired by [Binary Bonsai](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2004/11/21/freya-dissection/) here.

I'm also working on getting more regular with posting content. I found out that I can write posts in advance, and then set a date for the future, and the post won't show up on the front page until that time. This means that if I can get 5 or so posts ahead, then I can set a regular schedule (I'm thinking Monday, Wednesday, Friday right now) and get in the habit of regular updates. I think daily is a bit overkill, and (let's be honest) I'm not sure I really have that much to say.

Finally, I'm also working on my content a bit. I'd like this to become less of an "all about me and my cats" type of weblog, and be more focused on things that I'm interested in. I've always refrained from writing too much about video games and comic books because part of me was still ashamed of liking them, but those days are past me. It's time to write about what I know about, and that's web production, comic books, and other ultra-geeky endeavors.
