1. **2004: Finances** - We're aiming to pay off my Apple loan in the next month or two, and then pay back my parents and pay off the credit card at the same time.
2. **June 2004: Graduate** - If all goes according to plan, Annie will graduate with a BS in Sociology from PSU, in a collegiate career spanning seven years and three schools.
3. **Summer 2004: House-Hunt** - This isn't limited to the summer, but around then we'll probably start seriously looking at cities, neighborhoods, and houses in the Tacoma/Seattle area, as well as educating ourselves about the process of buying a home. Ideally, the next time we move, it will be into a house, not an apartment.
4. **2005: Move** - Assuming the savings and house-hunting goes well, we're thinking of moving some time in 2005. Maybe sooner, probably later, depending on how things go.
5. **2005: Better jobs?** - Annie wants to start doing some kind of work involving babies, though the exact type ranges from doula to nanny to starting Strawberry Studios and selling maternity clothing. I'm pretty happy at RR, but I'm open to the possibility of getting a better computer-related job, and I've been keeping an eye on the MicroSoft jobs sites in case the perfect job opens up. Hey, you never know...
6. **2005/6/7/?: Babies** - Yes, over the thundering applause from our parents and from Rose, you heard me say that we're thinking pretty seriously about having a baby sometime after we move into a house.
