oh man ... yesterday was the hardest bit of thinking i've ever put into programming.  
  
the result, though, is stunning! \[http://hatelife.org/\]  
  
hatelife's editing features are now a simple revision-control system, so that old content is never deleted - what makes this tricky, though, is that every post is now no longer "a post," but basically a revision-tree, so presenting threaded discussions means you have to collate all of the revisions of every post or reply into a single reply-tree (keeping track, too, of posts that are replies to other posts which have later been edited) ... it all turned out to be extremely tricky. any of you with logins on fojar should check out /disk/web/hatelife.org/www/classes/Data.php (the showReplies() and showThread() functions are the scariest) .....
