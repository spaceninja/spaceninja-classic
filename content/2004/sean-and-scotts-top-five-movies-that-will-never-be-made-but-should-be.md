- **Brotherhood of the Wolf prequels** - We want more! Take the pace and styling of the first half of the movie, and produce more stories about these characters taking place prior to the events in the movie. More kung-fu, more monsters, less of killing off the only character who was any good.

- **Titanic: The Series** - The Titanic falls through a "time hole," and every week, Jack and Rose must solve a Quantum-Leap style historical problem in order to advance to their next adventure. All "jumps" would be set pre-1900, so they are all in the character's past. There will be NO modern-day-crossover episode, which both Sean and I agree is the bane of nearly every sci-fi series. Only Star Trek ever pulled off visiting the 20th century, and even they didn't do it very well.

- **Hollow Army (alt. title: Hollow Men)** - After seeing _Hollow Man_, Sean came to me and said "If I had made it, there would have been a _team_ of hollow men, and half of them would have gone bad, leaving the other half to hunt them down. Of course, all the fight scenes would have to take place in special areas like underwater, or a steam room, or a dusty attic so the hollow men would be visible."

- **Half-Life: The Movie** - Sean and I have always thought a movie based on this game would be great, but there are a few conditions we would lay down. 1) No love interest. Hollywood, take note: Not every movie needs a romantic sub-plot. 2) Casting is important. Ted Raimi would play Gordon Freeman, but more importantly, Bruce Campbell would play Barney, the security guard. Not one Barney, who survives every scene, but many Barneys, as in the game, where just about every time a Barney gets killed by a horrible monster, you'll find another, also played by Bruce Campbell around the corner. 3) Directing is important. Sam Raimi would do this game justic, with minimal expansion of the already decent plot, and a good sense of humor throughout.

- **Scud the Disposable Assassin** - Based on the [popular comic book](http://www.scud.com/), this film would be produced using stop-motion animation (like those [christmas movies](http://ak.collectiblestoday.com/gallery/albums/blog-photos/product/450/1600598001.jpg)) using injection-molded models by Eric So and the other guys in this [Wired article about toys](http://wired.com/wired/archive/12.01/gijoe.html).
