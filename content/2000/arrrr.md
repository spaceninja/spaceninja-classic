ARRRR!

Ha ha I got my Chi Kung teacher saying it!

We were doing this exercise where the teacher digs his fingers into your sternum and cracks open part of your energy system, then throws you chest-first into another student. So I was the catcher, and the dude I was catching outweighs me by approx. 80 lbs, so to psych myself up, "ARRRR!" Tzun Tzun got into it.

TZ: "Arrr!" Me: "ARRR!" Tz: "Arr!" \*shrugs to the women students\* "It's a guy thing."
