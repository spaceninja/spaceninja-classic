Good news! I just got back from the social services office, and I now have a food stamps card.  
  
More good news! I witnessed three fighters from my gym mop the floor with their opponents last night at the Rose Quarter. It was a proud night for Grand Avenue Boxing :)  
  
Even more good news! Alex and Garrett of Braindead Monkeys fame will be in the area this weekend, and would very much like to hang out. I predict this will be a good thing.  
  
In other realms, there's not too much to report... The unemployment circus grinds onward, and I'm doing what job-hunting I can through this thick haze of vicadin. Getting the food stamps today took a lot out of my poor, mangled body, so I'm going to take a long nap and give myself some much-needed time to heal...
