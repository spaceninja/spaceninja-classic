Wow, a lot of people post to http://www.killingmachines.org/ around midnight! I was just reading, and replying and trying to catch up on two day's worth of posts, and about 10 people posted while I was reading! Pretty soon, I'm not going to be able to read everyone's journal anymore. But I think I can happily accept that KMorg is too popular for me to know everyone who posts there. :)

Oh, by the way, in case none of you realized it, I'm a huge geek. How geeky are you, no one in particular asks? I'm geeky enough that my mom bought me two [t-shirts](http://www.graphittidesigns.com/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/Store/p-SHRTMSC039.html?L+scstore+bypq6183ff70be70+1025341767) for my [birthday](http://www.graphittidesigns.com/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/Store/p-SHRTDC001.html?L+scstore+bypq6183ff70be70+1025343888), and one for [Annie](http://www.graphittidesigns.com/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/Store/p-SHRTDC286.html?L+scstore+bypq6183ff70be70+1025343890).

Tomorrow, Steve, Steph, Miles, Annie and I are going to the Tillamook Cheese Factory! And I guess some sort of sandy area with water or something. I wasn't paying attention to the last part of what Steve said, because I was busy doing a little excited-to-be-going-to-the-cheese-factory dance and cheering.
