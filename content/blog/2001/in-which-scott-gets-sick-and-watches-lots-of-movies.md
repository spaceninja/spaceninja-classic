Ugh. I've been sick. Urn had a cold, which somehow Annie caught. So of course, now I get sick, too. Which wouldn't have been so bad if Annie hadn't used up all the Kleenex and taken all the cold medicine with her when she went home for the weekend. Oh well. On a weekend when I had no larger plans than to stay home and be anti-social, I guess this is a better time to be sick than a normal workweek, when I can't afford to miss work. If I'm going to be miserable, it might as well be in the comfort of my own home.

One thing I've noticed about being sick is that my attention span gets even shorter than usual, and I get even more apathetic that usual. I don't feel up to doing anything more than sitting on the couch and watching TV, and I don't even really want to do that. As a result of this, when I get sick, I tend to watch a lot of movies. But due to my extremely short attention span, I can't handle movies with a great deal of plot. So I end up watching a lot of BAD movies.

This weekend, I rented _The Sixth Day_, which was about what I was expecting (Arnold blows things up and makes bad puns!), and the first _Highlander_, which was a lot worse than I remember. I also saw most of _Muppet Treasure Island_, which has some really funny pirate songs. Then there was some horrible made-for-TV _Mission To Mars_ knockoff on the sci-fi channel, a police chase documentary, about 15 minutes of _Wyatt Earp_, in which Kevin Costner makes a lousy Wyatt Earp, but the guy they got to play Doc Holliday is pretty cool. Add to all of those a couple hours of just channel-flipping, watching 10 minutes of Star Trek here, and 20 minutes of VH1 there. Sadly, I couldn't find any Bob Ross episodes anywhere. Bob Ross is the best thing to watch when you're sick. He was an amazing guy. And, of course, I watched _Iron Chef_. It's just about the best show ever.

_Addendum, 10 minutes later:_

I forgot to mention about 3 episodes of _Saturday Night Live_ and _The Replacement Killers_, which was much much worse than _The Killer_. Being sick, I wasn't even able to enjoy the fact that Mira Sorvino or however you spell her name left her shirt unbuttoned for the entire movie.
