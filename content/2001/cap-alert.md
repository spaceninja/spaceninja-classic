Hold on to your hang-ups, iiiit's... [CAP Alert!!](http://www.capalert.com) Watch in amazement as those wacky fundamentalists review movies such as: [The Matrix!](http://www.capalert.com/capreports/matrix.htm) [Fight Club!](http://www.capalert.com/capreports/fightclub.htm) (Remember that the trapped wolf will attack the one trying to free it!!) And, horror of horrors: [SOUTH PARK!!](http://www.capalert.com/capreports/southpark.htm)

It doesn't end there: Spawn! Ghost Dog! Down By Law! This site puts the "fun" in fundamentalism. I especially like the little "W.I.S.D.O.M." bar-graph of each movie's heathen content.
