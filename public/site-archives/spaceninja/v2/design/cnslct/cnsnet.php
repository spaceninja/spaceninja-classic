<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>The Network Team</B></FONT>

<br>The Network Team provides network connectivity to the Portland State 
University campus, including all academic and administrative offices, 
computer labs, and classrooms. The Network Team is also responsible for 
dial-up connections into PSU, the campus Internet and Internet2 connections, 
and network troubleshooting and monitoring. 

<p>The Network Team manages IP addressing on campus, including static and 
dynamic address assignments. We ensure appropriate and secure network 
connectivity to all locations on campus, in many cases providing switched 
10/100 to the desktop. We are also involved in the research and 
development of new network technologies and products. 

<p>We create and maintain maps of the campus network, both physical and 
logical, and monitor the status of other CNS services. Traffic and usage 
patterns are gathered and analyzed, so that the best possible service can 
be delivered to other functional areas of CNS and to the PSU community at 
large. Troubleshooting and technical assistance is provided by this team 
to aid in the resolution of complex problems. 

<p>This team works closely with Telecommunications, which does the physical wiring, and CNS teams that support the service and servers that network users rely on.
