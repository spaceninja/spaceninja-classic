> "Implication is more efficient than simulation." \-- [Don Hopkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins), summarizing Will Wright, discussing why [SimCity isn't as realistic](http://kotaku.com/gaming/simcity/will-wright-on-designing-simulation-interfaces-322438.php) as it appears.

**Update:** Edited to properly attribute the quote to Don Hopkins, based on his comment below.
