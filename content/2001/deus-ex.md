While I was in Milton visiting Annie, Dave introduced me to an amazing game. I've been playing [Deus Ex](http://www.deusex.com/) for about two weeks, and I just beat it last night. The game has an amazing story that begins with you as a secret agent and progresses through to you saving the entire planet.

While looking up information on Deus Ex 2 on a [website](http://www.planetdeusex.com/), I found a list of [cheats](http://cheatingplanet.com/cheats/pc/3061.shtml). Among those cheats was something called "matrix mode." If you turn it on, everything in the game looks like the scene where Neo starts seeing matrix code instead of the real world. No screenshot could do it justice, but here's one anyways. Just imagine all the code is streaming around. Personally, I think this is easily the best hidden feature I've ever found in any game.

And in case that's not cool enough, check this out. For years now, I've wanted to put a war room in my house. I've envisioned it in my mind, and while playing the game, I stumbled upon a room that happens to look almost exactly the way I imagined it. The globe rotates, of course.
