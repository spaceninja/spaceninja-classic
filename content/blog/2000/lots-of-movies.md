I've been watching a lot of movies lately. I love movies, and now that I have money again, it makes sense I would start seeing them again. Urn and I watched _Pitch Black_ (again for me) and it was still really really cool. I'm amped about _Red Planet_. Can't beat Val Kilmer, Trinity and a CG Robot! We saw _Charlie's Angles_, which was WAY better than I thought it would be. It has head nods to almost every kung-fu and action film ever made, from Bruce Lee to Mission Impossible, and it doesn't take itself very seriously at all, so it's totally fun to watch. Of course, all the boobies help. Annie and I rented _Tarzan_, which I've been meaning to see for a long time. Miles said it was cool, and I trust him. He was right. It was fun just to watch the way they made him move! We also watched _Titan A.E._, which I didn't think was that bad. I definitely enjoyed it, which was more than I expected from it. And finally, I watched the first half of the animated version of _The Hobbit_, which was actually pretty bad. Too many liberties with the plot for my liking. It makes me simultaniously nervous about and really excited for when they release the live-action _Lord of the Rings_ trilogy. My friend KT put it best: "They're releasing ONE a YEAR? WHAT IF I DIE BEFORE THE LAST ONE COMES OUT?"
