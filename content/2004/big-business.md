you do know that those low prices can cause serious problems for their suppliers, right?

problems like, in order to meet walmart's painfully low prices, being forced to export labor overseas, use cheaper materials, or else just bleed money until they go out of business, only to be replaced by an independent chinese factory that can sell jeans for a quarter a pair?

low prices are good for you but not for the world. it's one thing to be competetive, it's another to be so competetive nobody else can compete. that's what we call a 'monopoly' and in the 20s we created some laws to try to prevent companies like walmart from putting entire industries under one roof...

i could be wrong, maybe walmart cutting prices so hard nobody can even pretend to compete with them AND turn a profit is good, and maybe the world will be better off when every store is a wal-mart and all products are manufactured in china out of rice paper.

i'd kind of like to have my [kb](http://www.hoovers.com/kb-toys/--ID__102883--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml) back though.
