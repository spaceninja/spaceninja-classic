Last night I showed the gang part of a movie called [Yamakasi](http://www2.mediacorpsingapore.com/reviews/movies/view/109/1/.html") It's about a Paris subculture group who scale apartment buildings, jump from rooftop to rooftop, and perform assorted acrobatic stunts.  

  
It turns out they actually exist. They call their discipline ["Le Parkour"](http://pub77.ezboard.com/furbanfreeflowfrm11.showMessage?topicID=25.topic) and have groups in France and Belgium, and several [badly](http://membres.lycos.fr/leparkour/) [translated](http://216.239.35.120/translate_c?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://membres.lycos.fr/parkourll/Acceuil.php&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dparkour%26start%3D20%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26ie%3DUTF-8%26sa%3DN) web sites. There are even Parkour [videos](http://www.ugo.com/channels/freestyle/features/presto/) up on some Nike site.  

Right on. I love it when random extreme sports like this pop up. It feels like humanity is evolving for the better.

**UPDATE:** There's a Russian group, too! [Do you think will this way of extreme succeed?](http://www.tracers.ru/eng/alpphoto/photo4-10_02.htm)
