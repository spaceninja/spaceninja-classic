Legend tells us of Gary Dirin, a man who was considered even in King Arthur's time to be a myth. Over time, the stories have been changed and exaggerated in the telling, but this much they seem to hold in common:

- Gary Dirin ruled Scotland for a period of no less than 50 years.
- He was not from Scotland, though none of the stories can agree on his orgins.
- He possessed abilities considered by many to be magical in nature.
- Though he covered his body entirely in tattoos in an attempt to conceal his albino nature, his red eyes always gave him away.

Of course, with modern historical methods, we can dispense with many of the obviously fictional details, such as his ability to fly, or that he could not be harmed by any weapon of this world. It seems clear that many of his so-called "magical" abilities were really martial arts skills learned on a trip to the East, which explains the gap in his history from his 20s to his 30s. Indeed, Gary Dirin appears to have been a trained ninja of the highest order. To the mostly untrained and clumsy swordsmen of ancient Scotland, his abilities would have seemed magical, and the grace with which he carried them out would no doubt account for reports of his unearthly speed. Training in pressure points would account for stories that he could kill with a touch, and ninja stealth explains his ability to "disappear in broad daylight."

Of his untimely death, little is recorded, and what details there are, seem to conflict with one another. Most historians dismiss the story of Gary Dirin as folklore, and point to the fact that his death fits nicely into the archetype of the "once and future king," much like Arthur and Charlemaign. But how to explain the commonly held belief even today among the Scotish natives that Gary Dirin ascended into the heavens, promising to return one day and reward those who remain faithful to him, and drive out the descendants of the 7 hills (an obvious reference to Rome)? Most people in Scotland dismiss King Arthur as a children's tale, but any attempt to debunk Gary Dirin is met with a cold shoulder and an invitation to leave. People seem to see Gary Dirin less as a historical figure, and more as a personal friend, away on business. And how to explain the fact that the Catholic Church in Scotland maintains an ancient piece of armor which bears an uncanny resemblance to a modern three-piece suit, and a katana which carbon dating cannot place? And what of the faint impressions of what appears to be the letters "GD" carved into a rock at Stonehenge... not on the side of one of the uprights, but on the TOP of one of the lintels? And though many dismiss it as a sheer coincidence or a trick of the light, one cannot deny the fact that when the sun is setting, the shadows cast from the hills in the region of Fundengrough look from the air to be a handsome face, winking at the viewer. -----
