More from the Iraqi weblog. If you haven't started reading this, I \*highly\* recommend it.

> On BBC we are watching scenes of Iraqis surrendering. My youngest cousin was muttering “what shame” to himself, yes it is better for them to do that but still seeing them carrying that white flag makes something deep inside you cringe. we sit infront of the TV with the mao of Iraq on our laps trying to figure out what is going on in the south.
