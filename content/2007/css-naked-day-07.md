It's that time of year again when standards-conscious web designers shed their stylesheets and let their sites run around, exposing their raw markup to the world to promote web standards. The idea is that a standards-based site will be marked up semantically enough that even without the stylesheets, it's still usable, if not pretty. I can attest to the amount of time that we developers put into how a site will look without styles, even though few if any people will see it that way.

_Edit:_ Okay, so I'm 24 hours off. For some reason, I thought today was the 5th of April, but it was actually yesterday. \*sigh\* Restoring the styles now.
