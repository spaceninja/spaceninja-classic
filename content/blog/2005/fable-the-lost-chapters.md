What the hell? Why in the world would Lionhead Studios release [extra content for Fable](http://www.microsoft.com/games/fable/features.asp) (an x-box only game), but only release it on PC? There is no way that I'm paying another $50 just to get a few extra levels, which I then have to play on my PC, meaning I can't use my existing saved game or characters. This is idiotic.

Daniel: Any insight into this decision from someone inside the gaming industry?
