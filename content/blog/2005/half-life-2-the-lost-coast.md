The free expansion map for Half-Life 2, called "The Lost Coast" became available on Steam today. I downloaded it and it's pretty sweet. First of all, any additional gameplay for HL2 is a welcome addition, and I had fun shooting Combine soldiers again. But the coolest part is that it used a new lighting technique (which my computer can just barely handle!) that more accurately simulates what it's like for your eye when you walk out of a dark room into bright sunlight, for example. It also lets them give us settings that are even more incredible than the ones from the basic game, such as the church in the screenshot above.

The dev. team had some fun adding an audio commentary to the map, which places little floating cartoon word bubbles around the map. When you "use" them, an audio clip plays, usually explaining some little trick they did with the lighting where you're standing. It's mostly disposable, unless you're a game developer, but there were a few awesome bits where they take control of the game and show you three different shots of the same scene to illustrate how they render water refraction, or light blooms.
