I went to see the Royal Tenenbaums last night with Sean and Annie, and I've decided that I want a blatant lie carved on my tombstone. Perhaps one of the following:

- Died defending the planet from an invading race of horrific toad-men.
- Perhaps the greatest musical genius this world has ever known.
- He fought the law, and the law won.
- Faked his own death. Watch your back.
- 7'4", 520LB
- Three time Iron-Man contest champion.
- Three time Iron-Chef champion.
- He died the way he lived... inside a whale.
- Died at age 85 defending his World Giant Squid Wrestling Heavyweight championship.
- He tap-danced his way into our hearts.
- Single-handedly defeated the Soviet Menace.
- Fought crime wearing a bat costume he sewed himself.
- Updated his webcomic frequently (hahaha beat you to the joke, Miles!).
