I don't have much to post, except that I've started job-hunting. Wish me luck... I'll need it...

In other news: Did you know that there's a vast, labyrinthine maze of tunnels, buildings, caverns, and artificial courtyards lying underground, beneath the city of Portland?

Well, I discovered this in my sleep a couple nights ago. I think it's the result of thinking about the real tours of underground Portland and Seattle, combined with just finishing the book The Time Machine.

Underground Portland is pretty spread-out, and there are secret access points throughout the above-ground city. Near the end of the dream I was taken to "the apple tree," which looked more like an evergreen, and it was planted in the middle of someone's driveway. But sure enough, by lifting a grate we found the soil to be choked with stray apples, and as we dug into them my companion told me to be on the lookout for a shiny black detonator, which we would use to explode the apples somehow and clear the passage. Unfortunately I'd already picked up such a device, broke it into pieces, and tossed it back into the apple pit, so oh well.

Aside from that, I saw some subterranian concrete labs which had been converted into comfy sleeping spaces, and learned that there are all kinds of great reasons to get into the 'underground Portland scene' — there's treasure to be found, maps to be charted, adversaries to be fought... Unfortunately, it's a really exclusive venture. At its worst, you have to make yourself known in the underground for _years_ before you'll be trusted with the best secrets, certain special locations and access points where the _good_ stuff happens... I can only imagine what it is.
