<p><b>what is your position in the band?</b>
<br>I think you could sum it up best by saying that I am the heart and the soul of Yellow Number Five. I am the founding member and chief stockholder. I am the mad genius that keeps the creative pressure on my slacker bandmates. Some have called me a musical tyrant. And if by "tyrant," they meant "renaissance man," then they would be correct.

<p><b>what are your biggest musical influences?</b>
<br>Whenever I sit down to write some new music, I put the theme from Super Mario Brothers in, and follow it up with a heavy dose of [caffeine] and Japanese pop music.

<p><b>what's the one thing all your fans should know about you?</b>
<br>My full name is Dr. Harmann Colossus, and not "Jack-Ass," as some people seem to think.
