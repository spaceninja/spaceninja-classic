Yes, it's been an exciting week for [Fojar](http://www.fojar.com/). First, the virus crashes the router, cutting the connection, then Steve finds out that Fojar was hacked, necessitating a reinstall, and then he finds out that the ongoing downtime is the result of USWest deciding to delete that DSL account that Fojar is using.

And it's been a busy week for me as well. Between trying to load fojar and my email every five minutes, I managed to get quite a bit of stuff done. I scanned some photos of [Gavin](/site-archives/personal/v3/graphics/pals/gavin1.jpg), the one-year old [Annie](/site-archives/personal/v3/graphics/annie/anniegavin.jpg) and I hung out with in Ellensburg all last year and posted them to my [homepage](http://spaceninja.com/). Then I succumbed to peer pressure and created a new [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) strip, so you can all stop sending me hate mail.

I also completed two "new" skins for Rusted. I put new in quotes because I actually made these designs two years ago for [Hatelife v.1](/site-archives/hatelife/v1/hatelife.html). They got implimented about a week before the crash that led to the creation of [Hatelife v.2](/site-archives/kmorg/skins/hatelife.html). One is a nice black-and-white design with lightweight graphics called "[distress](/site-archives/kmorg/skins/distress.html)," and the other is a colorful text-only design called "[blue text](/site-archives/kmorg/skins/bluetext.html)."

And, in case that wasn't enough, I also have been working on my weekly art project. I'll be getting it online pretty soon, but I wanted to show off the most recent piece. While looking at a photo of the three agents from the Matrix, I realized that I had head shots of Miles, Steve and myself at the right angles. A little photoshopping later, I managed to produce [this lovely image](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3114097189/) of Agents Havelka, Johnson and Vandehey.
