I've just realized that I had one of those geek days. You know, where you start working on a project and completely lose track of time, and next thing you know, it's 9:30pm and you haven't had dinner yet.

Annie's been hanging out with her family all day while I was being anti-social, so I just called her to bring me some Taco Bell when she comes home. I think she must have taken pity on me not eating anything today, because she didn't even take the opportunity to tell me how bad Taco Bell is for me. ;)

Anyways, aside from wrasslin' with my weblog all day long, I also finally got around to rewiring my entertainment center for digital surround sound. By adding a new cable, I've suddenly gone from emulating 5.1 surround sound to true, honest-to-god dolby digital (or DTS) surround, which is awesome. I tested it out a bit on _The Matrix_ and _Oh, Brother_, but the most impressive 5.1 sound I had to use was definitely the shield charger from the opening scene in _Halo_, which spins around me in true 5.1 surround.

Okay, I know I said non-geek stuff, but I can't mention the first game without mentioning the sequel. It's excellent. I'll write a longer post later with more thoughts, but suffice to say that this rules, and I can't wait until some of my friends get their acts together and get on Xbox live so we can play online.

Let's see - other things - We're still unpacking, and I'll be doing another photo post soon (as soon as I find the USB cable). The house is starting to come together, but it's also getting pretty frustrating unpacking those last few boxes, and finding places to stash the last of our stuff. As Annie put it, "We're moving from the apartment we lived the longest to a much smaller apartment where we will live the shortest time."

We've been seeing Dave and Rose and Oskar almost every other night, which is quite nice. Right now, we're trying to get our acts together enough to go see _The Incredibles_. So far, we've missed the showtime twice. Turns out it's hard to schedule around a newborn. Who knew? ;)

I'm nearly done with work (just three weeks left!), but things are extremely frustrating right now. There's a ton of nonsense involving the lawyers and my non-compete clause that might prevent me from pulling in a big paycheck by going to GenCon in December, but it's too early to speak definitively about that. Things could go either way at this point, and I'm getting conflicting messages, so at this point, I'm just playing the waiting game and keeping my fingers crossed.

Annie and I joined NetFlix to help combat going stir-crazy in the house, and it rocks. We've been watching season one of _The West Wing_ and _The Office_, and Annie's been watching _Six Feet Under_, which I have mixed feelings about. West Wing is awesome, though.

HighLights and LowLights of the last two weeks:

- Opening the door for the delivery guy, and hearing him say "I guess this is your copy of Halo 2!"
- Breaking the new showerhead I was installing by screwing it on too tight (stupid plastic!)
- Eating pizza three nights in a row our first week.
- Getting our new bed - which is awesome.
- Having Comcast tell me it was Apple's fault.
- I have now held Oskar without him crying a total of four times! (granted, he was sound asleep all three, but I'll take my victories where I can find them).
- Realizing we will probably have to get a landline after all (stupid qwest!)
- Turning on my xbox live friends list every day - still no one on it. :(
- Missing our Portland friends and family.
- Recreating our new apartment in the Sims2 and seeing that our sims don't like it as much as our old one.
- Watching the neighborhood kids have a rock fight in the construction site outside our window.
- Getting the biggest slice of chocolate cake ever from the excellent Italian restaurant in our apartment complex's parking lot.
