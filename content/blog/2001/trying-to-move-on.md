I'm walking a tightrope lately. On the one hand, I can't turn the news off. On the other hand, I feel the need to do something else, even if just for a few hours. I've been hanging out with friends, trying not to talk about current events. I've also been on my computer a lot. It's exhausting to keep watching, but I feel guilty for stopping. It's like, "what right do I have to do fun things?" But life has to move on. I've done everything I can do.
