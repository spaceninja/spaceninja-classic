Progress is being made! The path is being paved for my triumphant return to Portland! Wednesday is my last day at ShirtWorks. Last Wednesday was my last day at the radio station. Friday, Annie's folks show up and we spend the day loading the truck. Today I got us a bunch of boxes. Aw Yeah.

**Countdown to Portland:** 6 days.
