_Way more information than you could possibly want about Scott's goals and projects_

- [Killing Machines](http://www.killingmachines.org/) final modifications and code cleaning, in preparation for v1.0 release. I set the goals for KMorg a long time ago, and we're just about there. In fact, from a user perspective, there probably won't be any difference between what's there and what I'm going to modify.
- [FCS version 2.0](http://tech.fojar.com/). Over the nearly year and a half since FCS v1 was released and then v1.1, many changes have taken place, and many improvements to the code, none of which have been added to the final distribution. Having basically taken over development on FCS in recent months for KMorg, Steve granted me permission to assemble a new definitive release of FCS to be labelled as v2.
- [Studio Fojar reorganization](http://www.studiofojar.com/). Following our geographic dispersal as well as our parting of ways over different goals, Studio Fojar fell by the wayside, and hasn't been touched in months (in fact, I actually forgot the admin password, and had to "hack" in). But with renewed interest in Mutton Kombat due to Miles' involvement in the Sprite World forums and it actually getting included in a macintosh freeware disk, not to mention Miles and I working on two new game projects, I think the time has come for a reorganization, with a focus on simplicity. Just one news board, one discussion forum, and a simpler directory structure.
- Server-Wide conversion to PHP/CSS layouts. Most of my websites that I don't post to frequently are suffering from old, bad code, and I'm itching to go through and rework them all to use my new coding standard, if not redesign them completely. Likely targets include [Yellow Number Five](http://www.yellow5.com/y5/), [my homepage](http://spaceninja.local/home/), [my portfolio](http://spaceninja.local/port/) and possibly [spaceninja.com](http://spaceninja.local/) itself, though I'm hesitant to mess with an effective design that I'm still proud of. As well as considering redesigns, I'm considering consolidation. I've got a lot of sites up, and only a couple that I pay close attention to. Perhaps the time has come to take some of them down...

Anyways, there you have it. I have no idea how quickly any of this will get done, as my job tends to keep me fairly occupied, and my new X-Box with the copy of Halo that should be arriving soon will no doubt take up the rest of my time. However, I saw a quote recently, that really put things in perspective for me, and I'm striving to live up to it.
