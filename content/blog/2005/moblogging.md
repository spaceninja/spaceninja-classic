Guess who just had delicious crab puffs for lunch, and is currently blogging from Pioneer Square in downtown Portland?

That's right, ME, baby.

I came downtown at 9am for a job interview with another placement agency. I think it went very very well, and they already are submitting me to a certain job that sounds awesome. If it's everything they're saying, then it's exactly what I'm looking for, and I could be very happy.

Keep your fingers crossed!
