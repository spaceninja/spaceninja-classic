Sean and Annie and I went to go see _The Village_ last night. I was a little apprehensive, since the movie got horrible reactions just about everywhere. By the time we came out, though, Sean and I agreed that while this wasn't Shyamalan's best movie, the only thing it suffered from was a weaker-than-normal premise. Unlike his other movies, I had a good idea of what was going on the whole time in this movie, and he never once made me jump. There was a usual selection of creepy imagery, but nothing that was bad enough to keep me up at night. And, because it's Shyamalan, he still managed to keep me guessing the whole time - even if it was just wondering if he was really going to stick with this simple a setup.

Anyways, sorry for the obtuse writeup - I don't want to give anything away for anyone who may not have seen it, but I also wanted to reassure people that it's nowhere near as bad as people made it out to be. Just don't expect it to be as good as his other films, and you'll be pleased.

On a side note, if you remove all the horror-movie elements, you're left with a really nice love story. The main female character, Ivy, had some really good lines, and all the dialog involving her actually reminded me of a Tom Stoppard play.
