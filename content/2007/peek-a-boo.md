I had my first day back at work today after two weeks at home with the ladies. I've got a lot to talk about, but I'm too tired to type it out right now, so I'm just going to share two of my favorite photos from the last few days. Both of them were taken on my cell phone. Every time I snap a photo like this, I'm glad that I put the time into comparison shopping camera phones - especially when you compare it to the photos that [Annie's camera](http://flickr.com/photos/strawberrystudios/408395081/) takes. Anyways, lots of content coming very soon, in the meantime, enjoy these photos (and there's [plenty more](http://flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/tags/zoe) where they came from).
