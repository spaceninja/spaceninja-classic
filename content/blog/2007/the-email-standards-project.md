In 1998, Jeffrey Zeldman co-founded [the Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org/) to fight for better support of web standards from the browser manufacturers and web developers. It was a success, if for no other reason than it provided a flag to rally behind.

This year, [the Email Standards Project](http://www.email-standards.org/) was founded to rally support for web standards in email clients.

> The Email Standards Project is about working with email client developers and the design community to improve web standards support and accessibility in email. The project was formed out of frustration with the inconsistent rendering of HTML emails in major email clients.
>
> Our mission is to drive the use and support of web standards in email, working with email client developers to ensure that emails render consistently. This is a community effort to improve the email experience for designers and readers, and weâ€™d love your help.

Given Microsoft's [recent slide backwards](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html) on this front in Outlook 2007, the need for a group like this has never been higher. Let's hope they're able to get the kind of results the Web Standards Project eventually got.
