hey everyone, quick band update - ensemble berceanu is playing next tuesday, july 8th, from 7 to 10pm at the county cork, a smoke-free irish pub on 13th and fremont. yeah, yeah.. an irish pub. wheeeee. ;) no cover, of course. we are without a bassist this gig, sadly. i'll be playing at a polka fest later in the week, either thursday or friday, not sure which.
