[Saint Germain - an 18th Century James Bond](http://www.alchemylab.com/count_saint_germain.htm)

While checking out the website for one of my favorite musicians, [St. Germain](http://www.bluenote.com/artistpage.asp?ArtistID=3670&tab=1), I noticed a note on the biography.

> "At the court of Louis XV in 18th century France, there was a character who amazed everyone by pretending to be several centuries old." [\*](http://www.bluenote.com/artistpage.asp?ArtistID=3670&tab=1)

I did a little more research online, and stumbled across [several sites](http://www.jules.org/saint-germain.html) with some [more information](http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/s/saint_germain.html) on the [historical Saint Germain](http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=66537&tocid=0&query=saint%20germain). The most interesting one however, [can be found here](http://www.alchemylab.com/count_saint_germain.htm).

This page presents Saint Germain (who was not a Saint, but named himself after a town by that name) as an immortal alchemist, confidant to the king and queen, celebrity of sorts, and an international spy. Personally, I agree with one of the other websites, which says:

> "In reality, he was a true charmer, a consummate showman and, probably, a royal spy. Legend, and his followers, claim he never died, but historical records indicate he... died around 1784. ...He was a well-educated man and a showman, perhaps in the same league as P.T. Barnum, although in a different arena." [\*](http://www.jules.org/saint-germain.html)

But regardless of the truth behind it, you can't help but get a kick out of reading about a man who claims to have personally known Nero and Dante, predicted the French Revolution, had an important role in the Russian Revolution, started FreeMasonry, and may still be alive today.
