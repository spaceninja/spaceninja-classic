Urn and Kat threw a great party for New Year's. They had everyone wear pajamas, and Dave and Rose tried to set up a wine tasting (which turned into more of a wine drinking). The highlight of the night was definitely that Pat was there. Everyone was glad to see him back from Iraq, and he gave out gifts of old Iraqi money with Saddam on it.

Urn had bought one of those holiday packs of Jones soda, which we opened, and split among several glasses for everyone to sample. We started with the mashed potatos and butter flavor, which smelled strongly of movie-theater-popcorn-butter, but tasted like mashed potatos, with a slightly rancid aftertaste. Everyone hesitantly sniffed their glasses, and then slammed them back like whiskey. The reaction was unanimous - this stuff was HORRIBLE. Next up was the green bean cassarole, which didn't smell as bad, but tasted worse. Then came the cranberry - which pretty much tasted like cranberries. No one grimaced, but no one was impressed either. We all just kind of shrugged and moved on. Then came the Turkey and Gravy flavor. This was, without a doubt, the worst of the batch. It tasted FOUL (not fowl) and Annie swears it was stringy, like it was actually pureed turkey. Last of all was fruitcake, which was like cranberry and pretty unimpressive. Everyone agreed that these flavors were a terrible idea, and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who felt a bit ill afterwards.

We stayed the night, going to sleep around 4am, and waking up around 8am. Dave made Eggs Benedict and breakfast burritos, and we played some Dead Or Alive Beach Volleyball, which is hilarious. Also, we watched Dave work out to the xbox fitness game that Urn has (which I just bought a copy of).

Ugh, this narrative is starting to bug me, because I'm just listing what happened without telling you anything about it, so I'm just going to stop now.

**New Year's Resolutions**

- Get up at a regular time every weekday (10am)
- Work out 15 minutes every weekday
- Accomplish at least one thing every day before playing games (web design, etc.)
- Do more web design
- Post more frequently, and use more images in my posts
