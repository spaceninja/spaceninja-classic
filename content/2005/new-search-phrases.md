I'm happy to report that I have some goofy new search phrases in my log files:

[ninja photos](http://www.google.com/search?q=ninja+photos) - Sadly, I'm not sure what these guys were looking for. I got 6 hits for this, and they must have been disappointed. I'm not in the top ten for this one.

[outlaw biker](http://www.google.com/search?q=outlaw+biker) - Only six hits, and I'm not in the top ten results, but I'm sure they were sent here for [this post](/2005/06/outlaw-biker/).

[pirate bar](http://www.google.com/search?q=pirate+bar) - Nine hits, and I'm in the top four results! Obviously, they're coming for my [post](/the-pirate-bar/) about the awesome pirate bar we went to.

[spirit journey formation anniversary](http://www.google.com/search?q=spirit+journey+formation+anniversary) - This is the one I'm most proud of. 21 hits, and they're all going to my [birthday program](http://spaceninja.local/projects/dates/). Since this one isn't a blog entry, it might stay near the top of the search results for the goofy phrase (which is from the cartoon Aqua Teen Hunger Force).
