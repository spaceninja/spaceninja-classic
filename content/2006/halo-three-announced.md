Bungie finally decided to admit that they're working on Halo 3, but at least [they have a sense of humor about it](http://bungie.net/News/TopStory.aspx?link=Halo3Announcement). The good news is that it looks good, and it seems to be picking up the plot threads from the novels, which is great. The bad news... well, I'm not sure there is any here. It's still Halo, and even if I'm upset at the ending from Halo2 and the way Bungie has been acting lately, they make a great game, and I'll play it. Plus, it's an excuse to buy a 360.
