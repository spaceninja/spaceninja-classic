[![Battlestar Galactica Razor](/images/2045699997_aae8ca58be.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2045699997/)

Last week, Annie and I went to Seattle to see the [special two-hour episode of Galactica](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/razor/), Razor. Microsoft was sponsoring a free screening in select cities, and one of the theaters happens to be near Annie's parents, and we weren't going to pass up the chance to see Galactica on the big screen. It was totally worth it, too. Razor takes place during season two, and tells the story of Lee Adama's first mission in command of the _Pegasus_. In flashbacks, we follow the new character of Kendra Shaw, from the moment she gets assigned to the _Pegasus_, through the Cylon attack and following months, filling in the holes in the story, and giving more background to explain how and why they made the decisions they did. In the end, I still dislike Admiral Cain and the decisions they made still sicken me, but I feel like I understand where they were coming from a lot better than I did before. If it feels like I'm avoiding any specifics of the plot, you're right, there are some excellent surprises in here, and I don't want to ruin them, so I'll just say that this story is absolutely worth watching, and the events that happen here help to set up what's coming in season four.
