I've been spending a lot of time flipping through the news channels watching the coverage of Hurricane Katrina, and I'm absolutely stunned at how bad things are, and the fact that they're getting worse by the minute. I'm going to talk to Annie about whether we can scrounge together some money to donate to the Red Cross. In the meantime, the [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) page about the [effect on New Orleans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_Hurricane_Katrina_on_New_Orleans) is a good reference page, which is getting updated on a frequent basis.

**update:** Sweet, Annie and I were able to donate $100 on our credit card.
