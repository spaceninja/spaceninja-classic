Nothing much to say lately. My desire to post is at an all-time low, due to all the wedding stuff going on. Suffice to say, while I'm still excited about the wedding, I'm also ready for it to be over. In the meantime, here are some cool things to amuse yourself with.

[Zombie Infection Simulation](http://kevan.org/proce55ing/zombies/) - By Kevan Davis. This Java simulator will show you a top-down view of a city full of people, and introduce a single zombie, showing how quickly a zombie infection can spread.

[Zombie Infection Simulation With Fighting](http://zombies.insertdisc.com/mattcordes/) - By Matt Cordes. This is a modification of the original Zombie Infection Simulator, with code added to allow the humans to fight back sometimes. It's a little slower than the original, but still cool.

[Truck Dismount](http://jet.ro/dismount/) - This is a game you can download that will allow you to simulate slamming a truck into a wall at high speed, to give maximum damage to the driver. It sounds horrible, but it's wonderful. The boys were playing it on my computer for a long time last night.

Also, there's some new [hammerspace](/site-archives/hammerspace/v2/) strips up.
