If you're a gamer, then you probably know that this month is when two of the most eagerly awaited games ever finally came out: Half-Life 2, and Halo 2. If you're not a gamer, you're probably wondering where your husband is. And the answer is: probably over at my house, playing Halo 2. First of all, Halo. Let me first say that I haven't beaten it yet. (I'm currently in the Library, which has proven just as tricky the second time around.) However, I've played through quite a bit of the game already, and I'm aware of the buzz about the rest of the game. Common reactions are that the game is too short, too easy, and that the storyline is overall disappointing.

I'm not sure I agree with the first two. Of course, any ending at all will leave me wanting more, but I've been playing for a good while now, and I haven't hit the end. I'm satisfied with the length (so far). As for difficulty, I'm breezing through the game playing on Normal difficulty, but I've been watching Dave struggle in Heroic, and from our experiences in co-op on Heroic, I think it's safe to say it's a good step up. Of course, there's always Legendary beyond those.

As for the story, I will admit that so far it hasn't been overwhelming. What's there is good, and I'm not going to complain about it. What I will complain about (a bit) is what's NOT there. Following the original game, I became a loyal follower of Bungie, and read the whole [Marathon story site](http://marathon.bungie.org/story/), and then the [Halo story site](http://halosm.bungie.org/story/). After that came the [Halo books](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/halo/spotlight.htm) (HIGHLY recommended), and then the storyline introduced in [I Love Bees](http://qube.netninja.com/beewiki/FrontPage).

In every case, it was proved that Bungie is a company that is adept at crafting epic (if generic) science fiction worlds, and that the story told in their games usually only scratches the surface. This is certainly true of the Marathon games and the first Halo game, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be true in Halo.

But that still leaves me slightly disappointed. In the last few years I have been filling my brain with the tantalizing possibilities and speculation and theories about the original Halo, and it's hard not to feel let down when Halo 2 doesn't even _mention_ the events in the books, such as the other surviving spartans, or the artifacts that were found.

The current rumor is that Halo 2's ending was chopped due to time constraints. I will only say that I find this suspect given Bungie's never-ceasing reputation for putting everything they can (and then some) into their games, and the fact that they were under no time pressure other than their own to release Halo 2. The idea that they would spend two years saying "It's done when it's done, and not before", only to cut several chapters is hard to buy into.

BUT. It does open the door for an interesting new possibility. Maybe they intentionally cut those last chapters so that they could release them over xbox live. I have no indication that this is what's happening, or even that this is possible - but hell, wouldn't you pay a few bucks to download more Halo2 content over the net?

Anyways, I'll reserve final judgement until I finish the game, but I suspect that even then I'll stick with my original opinion, that we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I just hope they write more novels!

Multiplayer, of course, is incredible. I've been too chicken to get on xbox live yet, I think I'll have to wait until I have some friends online before I jump in the deep end of the pool, but I'm looking forward to it. Dave and I have been goofing around on multiplayer maps, and they're fascinating. Bungie said one of their goals was to avoid symmetrical maps, and they've done it. And of course, the remixes of the original halo multiplayer maps are hilarious. Can't wait to see what the guys at [Red Vs. Blue](http://www.redvsblue.com/) do with them.

Which brings me to Half-Life 2. Aside from [my difficulties getting it installed](/blog/2004/steam-kinda-sucks/), I have been absolutely floored by this game.

First of all - it is breathtakingly beautiful. You have never played a game that looked this good. The people in Doom 3 and Halo 2 both feature bump-mapping on their skin, which makes them look better than anything before, but also very rubbery, like they're wearing masks. It's an improvement, but it's nowhere near realistic. Half Life 2 people look incredible. They're still stylized, but their skin looks like skin, and they move realistically, and their faces express emotion.

I've only played the opening chapter and a bit of the jetbike level that follows - and the reason I didn't get further is because I was just wandering around the opening level staring at things and people. All the people look different, and they all have little personalities of their own. The world really comes alive through them - which only serves to make the Combine even more faceless and creepy.

Story-wise, there's nothing for me to tell yet. They haven't even told me what I'm doing yet, aside from hooking up with old buddies from Black Mesa (The way they introduce Barney is fantastic). The G-Man is creepier, due to his speech impediment (reminds me of the way people describe Men In Black talking). But based on the first game, I'm sure I'm in for a treat with the plot.

And honestly, at this point, they could have the worst plot in the world stuck on there, and I would still rate this as one of the best games ever just based on the visuals and the rock-solid gameplay.

I've only played for a few hours so far, and I'm already in love.

Halo 2 is impressive - for the xbox. Half Life 2 is revolutionary.

I just cannot express enough how incredible Half Life 2 is. This is particularly suprising, since I expected Halo to be the clear winner over HL, but it's turned out the other way around.

I might even buy it again when it comes out on xbox, so I can see what it plays like compared to Halo, on a joystick.

Sigh. This review was going pretty well until I got to Half Life. I'm sure part of it is that I've had a few days to absorb my feelings about Halo, and HL is brand new - but my complete incoherence should really only serve to further illustrate how great it is. No, it's better than great. There's no word to describe how great Half Life 2 is - so I'm forced to make one up. Half Life 2 is _Scrumtrillecent_.
