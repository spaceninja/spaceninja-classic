A List Apart is hosting the first annual [Web Design Survey](http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey) in an effort to learn more about the people in the web design profession - presumably so we can have more efficient debates in the future about why there aren't more women and minorities in web design. If you work in the web design industry, you should be taking this survey.
