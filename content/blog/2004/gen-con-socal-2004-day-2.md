Day two went very well indeed. We're pretty much a full day ahead of schedule now. All the registration workstations are set up and configured, and the server seems to be working fine. Tomorrow we'll be testing printing and setting up the game LAN, where most of us plan on spending the week. It's really nice how smoothly things are going. Once again, not much to tell, though. We spent the day in the server room, with occasional trips downstairs to work on the registration machines.

On a side note, I've been watching CJ play World of Warcraft all day, and it's awesome. It addresses all of the problems that I had with City of Heroes. CJ's going to let me use his guest account to try it out this week.

**edit:** I forgot to mention that they gave us a couch this year! So our server room has tables around three walls, with geeks on laptops typing away, and a nice couch on the fourth wall. Also, the window in the room, which looked out on an empty hall last year, looks out over the exhibit hall this year, so we've got a decent view.
