Okay, so [Progress Quest](http://progressquest.com/) is actually pretty funny. You gotta love a game that advertises itself by saying "Gamers who have played modern online role-playing games, or almost any computer role-playing game, _or who have at any time installed or upgraded their operating system_, will find themselves incredibly comfortable with Progress Quest's very familiar gameplay."
