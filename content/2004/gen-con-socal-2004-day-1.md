Not much to report today. I got up at 5am to catch a 7:15am plane to Anaheim. It is cold here, but sunny (the news is running alarming stories about the cold snap, and the sub-40 temperatures). When the server arrived after lunch, we sat around for a few hours waiting for Harold to get the server up and running. In the meantime, the convention center guy entertained us at great length with complicated conspiracy theories. In addition to telling us that the election was rigged by the descendants of Christians from the Crusades, he told us that JFK was killed for being a Catholic, or maybe an Ancient Roman. It really stopped making much sense after awhile (But I didn't make up the part about JFK being a Roman). After the server was configured, we went back to the hotel, where we had cheesecake, and now I'm going to bed.
