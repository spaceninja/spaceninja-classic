I'll be the first to admit that I'm not as skinny as I was in high school. I am no longer a 98 pound weakling. No, now I'm a 170 pound weakling. Sadly, all of this weight has gone on right around my middle giving me a bit of a gut. Naturally, I'm not terribly pleased with this, but I'm not so disgusted by my appearance to start doing anything drastic to fix it either. I'm a long way from fat.

However, while it is true that I'm not as skinny as I used to be, I am SICK of people I barely know commenting on it! One time, at work, I wore my "chicks dig scrawny pale guys" shirt, and my boss of less than a month, who I barely knew, walked up and said "Not very scrawny, though, are you?" I was shocked that he felt comfortable saying this, but accepted it as the joke it was probably intended as, though I did rant a bit about it to my friends at the time. This has happened to me a couple times now, and I don't like it, but the worse one yet happened yesterday. A guy from the radio station, who I know only by association (basically, we just know each other's names) and I are sitting around waiting for the rest of the people in the large group to show up, and I say that I'm hungry, and I say "We should order a pizza. Several pizzas!" I was joking. Not my best joke, but still...

"You look like you've already had too many pizzas." He remarked. I was absolutely stunned. "excuse me?" and "fuck you!" were two responses that ran through my mind before he then leaned forward and asked "I mean, what are you, 23?" I was so shocked all I could do was nod. It sucks because I should have told him to shut the hell up, or at least said something, but I was so startled that he had the nerve to say something that rude to me that I just sat there and took it.
