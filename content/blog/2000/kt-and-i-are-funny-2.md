Part of me enjoys the fact that I'm not watching much TV lately. I enjoy television, and KT and I have been getting together for Sunday night television for a long time, which I really like.

Now, the season's ended, and due to finals I stopped watching. Finals have since ended, and I'm still not watching TV. I watched some with KT tonight for the first time in a couple of weeks.

So here, I'm feeling all good about doing things in real life and not watching TV all the time, and we sit down to watch the "top 100 comedy movies of all time." There are so many movies I need to see. Woody Allen, the Marx Brothers, the Graduate, the original M\*A\*S\*H movie, and Bob Hope. They played little clips, and all these old black and white flicks are so freaking funny! Bob Hope and the other guy he's with are in prison, and one guy relates the story so far, and the other guy goes "I know all that!" and he replies "Yeah, but the people who walked into the picture halfway through don't!" (pointing at the audience). The other guy pauses for a second, and then goes "They missed my song?" Such good stuff. And Buster Keaton makes Jacky Chan look like a pansy.

So I really want to see this stuff, but I want to watch less TV? I guess I'll have to balance it and just watch a little at a time.

Interesting note: Ghostbusters and Airplane were in the list, sandwiched between woody allen movies and marx brothers, but Blues Brothers, Strange Brew and The Jerk weren't. Strange.

KT and I are really funny sometimes. Well, at least we get a big kick out of each other. She went to shut the curtains, and I said "Why are you shutting the curtains? Do you want some priiivacy?" and we both busted up. But maybe that's only funny to us.

The phone rang, and she picked it up, and I assumed she was talking to someone she knew, based on how rude she was being. She was grinning, and she was saying the meanest things! It was like an exaggerated version of how you would be rude to someone. Turned out it was a wrong number. Granted, the guy's called her like 50 billion times, once a week or so, and always asks for the same guy, and every time, KT tells him that he needs to dial 9 because he's on campus.

But then she says "You need to put a note on your phone! We have this conversation every time you call! Every time you ask me if Micheal's here, and I tell you to dial 9! Put a note on your phone! How did you get into college?" Then she hung up on him.

It was rad.
