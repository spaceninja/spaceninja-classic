I am filled with hate.  
  
Okay... I work for a company that makes registration software. As a result, the clients that I deal with are people who want registration software on the internet, but don't know enough about computers to do it themselves. Usually, this results in people who are somewhat timid, and afraid to express their ignorance of computers, meaning they're easy to please, and usually a joy to work with.  
  
But a few of our clients are headstrong opinionated jackasses people who have their own ideas about the way things should work and aren't about to flex on any issue, no matter how minor.  
  
Now, that being said, I'm fine with this... to a degree. As a client, you have a right to expect a certain amount of service for the money you paid, and as a person, you have a right to your own opinions about how a registration system should work.  
  
However, as a client, you have paid for an existing piece of software, which works a certain way. If your ideas about how it should work don't synch up with the way it actually works, there are two solutions. One is that you can pay to have the system customized to match your specifications. Two is that you can adapt to the way the system currently works, and accept the PLENTIFUL and GOOD-NATURED help that the support staff (me) provides.  
  
Now, if people stuck to those two options, I'd be perfectly happy. However, some of our customers opt for option number three: Compain endlessly, and attempt to browbeat the help into recognizing that their way is the only possible way to do things, and then insulting people when they don't agree with you.  
  
AAAAAAGHAHAHAHAHAGLKHAGLKAHALKJASDHATEHATE  
  
I just spent a gut-wrenching half-hour on the phone with one of our clients listening to her expound at length about how dumb our system is and how it doesn't make any sense and how we should really fix it to work her way, because it doesn't make any sense to have it any other way and DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE  
  
\*deep breath\*  
  
I feel a little better. Now I'm going to go play video games and have a popsicle.
