I'm going to Phoenix today for a business trip. That makes it sound formal, but I'm looking forward to it. Over time, as we've hired more programmers, they've all ended up being in Phoenix, so Mogenns decided that we should all meet face-to-face. So today I'm climbing into a plane to fly to Arizona with my boss, into 100+ degree temperatures. Oddly enough, I've packed jeans and a sweatshirt, because we'll be spending all day in an air-conditioned meeting room, and I'll probably be freezing.

I'm taking my camera, so I'll post some photos when I get back on Saturday!
