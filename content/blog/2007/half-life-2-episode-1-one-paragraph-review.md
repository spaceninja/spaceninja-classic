[![Half-Life 2 Episode 2](/images/2091149035_4f4eb739a2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2091149035/)

I was going to write a review, but instead I'm going to quote from an email [Miles](http://isometric.sixsided.org/) sent me, because he puts it better than I ever could:

> "It cracks me up how schizophrenic it is between apocalyptic horror and tongue-in-cheek wish fulfillment. On the one hand: Alien slavers colonize the earth! They're sterilizing humanity, draining the ocean for minerals, and infesting our ecosystem with hostile alien species. On the other hand: everyone of any significance to the story is a Physics PhD! SUPEREMPOWERED NERDS DUKE IT OUT FOR THE FATE OF HUMANITY! You spend the entire game running around with a 22-year-old babe who's a self-taught physicist, roboticist, electrical engineer, sniper, and alien-technology hacker; she's a crack shot with rifle, pistol, and shotgun alike; she climbs walls like a parkour master, and high-kicks zombies so hard that their heads come off!"

And a bonus paragraph from a letter that Miles is "mentally composing to Gabe Newell about ep2," complaining about the death of CENSORED.

> "I mean, I know that you're Valve and hl2 is a Dark Catalogue of Human Nightmares like war, zombies, Orwellian fascism, environmental collapse, and extinction, but get real: The player has spent nearly the entire game tear-assing around the Bavarian forest in a chopped muscle-car with his electrical-engineer / commando / babe sidekick crawling across the hood to ride shotgun, with a literal keg of whup-ass hooked to the back bumper, earning the raucous cheers of the men when he uses said keg to dispatch looming alien tanks (with great dispatch, even.) It's the height of insensitivity to cap this all off with, 'and then two monsters came out of nowhere and killed CENSORED.'"
