[![Zoe Eating Burritos 3](/images/2700148037_f15cafabf2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2700148037/)

It wasn't too long ago that Zoe used to be completely uninterested in food. While her cousins and friends would gleefully eat anything and everything on their parents' plates, Zoe would pick uninterestedly at her food and then tell us that she was "all done."

We weren't really worried about it, because we knew that every kid approaches food differently, and in time she would come around. Sure enough, looking through her photos now, I find her happily eating all the time.

She likes green beans, broccoli, meatballs, chicken, sandwich meat, and refried beans. She adores black olives and freeze-dried fruit, and she even nibbles on bread sometimes. She's still a bit pickier than her friends, and flatly refuses to eat some things (like tortillas, pickles, or anything that comes on a spoon). Still, it's clear that she's developing her own tastes, and as you can see from these photos, we're not missing out on those classic baby-covered-in-food moments!
