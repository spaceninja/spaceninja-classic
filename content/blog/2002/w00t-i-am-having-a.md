w00t! I am having a great weekend! I got to sleep in yesterday, then I woke up and Annie and I went to Everyday Music, where we finally got a copy of _The Mirror Consipiracy_ by Thievery Corporation, as well as an album by Little Louie Vega, which has one really good house/techno track on it that I may use as background music in a flash animation I may make someday. Then I played games all afternoon. Then Miles came over, and then Zach, Eric, Zima, and Ben came over, and we ordered pizza and hung out, and then Miles and I showed everyone [HomeStar Runner](http://www.homestarrunner.com/). Then everyone else went to see _An American Teenage Mutant Ninja Werewolf In Paris_ or something while I played more computer games. Then Miles, Zach and Sean came over. Zach went home, but Miles and Sean stayed and played GTA3 and Jet Set Radio until 5 AM.

Then this morning, the alarm went off at 9am, and I was frustrated for a few minutes until I realized it wasn't MY alarm, it was Annie's! So she got up and went to work and I got to sleep in again, and now I'm about to take Daniel (who is in town since his company went belly-up) to see Amilie at the Laurelhurst... and later on there might even be more computer gaming! Hooray!

(Yeah, alright, not the most thrilling weekend, but I'm loving it!)
