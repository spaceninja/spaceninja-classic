OPEN SCENE
\[camera slowly pans around the living room, moving into the office, where we see our hero sitting in front of his computer, talking on the phone, looking relaxed\]

**Scott:** Okay, KT, I just bought four tickets for SpiderMan for tomorrow night.
**KT:** They'd better have the old spider-man theme song in the movie or I'm gonna be mad.
**Scott:** Yeah, that would be...

\[our hero sits bolt upright in his chair\]

**Scott:** SHIT! I just bought the four tickets for TONIGHT! We have 25 minutes to get to the theater!
**KT:** Ummm...
**Scott:** Be outside your house in 10 minutes! We're coming to get you!

\[Joined by his girlfriend Annie and his brother Sean, our hero sprints to the nearest flexcar, where he and Sean discuss whether they'll make it in time, while Annie drives. A frantic race to the theater follows, resulting in our heros arriving just in time to catch the last preview and watch the movie\]

((And in case you were wondering, yes, the old spider-man theme song played at the end of the credits, and there was much rejoicing.))
