Tonight was hair night. Annie and Kat bought bleach and dye, and then around 7pm Urn and I joined in. I got my hair cut shorter (I'm still looking for employment so I can't get too radical with my hair), Urn and Kat tinted their hair red, and Annie first bleached and then died her hair bright red. I'm not kidding. Fire Engine Red. Crayola Red. It's really bright red dye. Her hair's pretty dark, so after bleaching it was yellow, so it's a bright red/orange now. It's really really cool. I've been wanting her to do this ever since we saw _Run Lola Run_. We took photos, but unfortunately, Urn's stupid webcam is broken, so you'll have to wait until they get developed to see them.
