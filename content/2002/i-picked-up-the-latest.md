I picked up the latest Willamette Week, and it looks like there's a lot of good movies about to hit theatres, but especially this one: SPIRITED AWAY! It's an anime flick from the creator of Princess Mononoke, and everyone who's seen this movie has loved it to tears. It opens here tomorrow (Friday) at the Fox Tower. Who is down for the going!!  
  
It shows at 7:10 and 9:50... Anyone interested? Is Saturday or Sunday better for you? Hmm hmmmmm?
