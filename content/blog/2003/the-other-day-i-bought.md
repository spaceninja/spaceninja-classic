![blue chair](/images/blue_chair.jpg)![red chair](/images/red_chair.jpg)The other day I bought a new computer chair. My old one was getting pretty beat up. The height adjustment lever didn't work anymore, and the back support was bent at a 45 degree angle, which made it difficult to sit comfortably. So, seeing as I spend upwards of eight hours a day in this chair, I decided to get a new one. So Annie and I went to the discount office supply store, and checked out a ton of chairs. Most were either really nice, but cost several hundred dollars, or were totally worthless, and cost fourty-five dollars. This red chair, however, was just about perfect. It was an acceptable fabric, a nice tall back, with decent lumbar support, and not a lot of moving parts that could break off. Plus, it was in good condition and only cost $100, which was the price I was aiming for.
