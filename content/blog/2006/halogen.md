Since [Sean's posting Halo news](http://nyarlo.net/boggle/2006/04/10/orion/) over on his blog, I might as well throw up something Halo-related on mine. There's an excellent Halo TC for C&C Generals under development by [Slipstream Productions](http://slipstreamproductions.net/), called [HaloGen](http://halogen.slipstreamproductions.net/). The [screenshots](http://halogen.slipstreamproductions.net/post_images/scorpioncharge.jpg) [look](http://halogen.slipstreamproductions.net/post_images/firefight.jpg) [incredible](http://halogen.slipstreamproductions.net/post_images/chaoticbattle.jpg), and the Generals engine should be perfect for this. I can't wait to play some RTS Halo!
