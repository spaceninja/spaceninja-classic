<h1 class="header">Who made this site?</h1>

Three guys, Scott, Sean, and Steve.<p>

Scott did the graphic design and HTML layout for the pages.  See more of
Scott's work <a href="http://www.spaceninja.com/">here</a>.  He's also not
here to hype himself maximum.<p>

Sean worked on the PHP for the employers section.  He just started working
in the bay area doing PHP and is hoping he gets at least two paychecks
before proving his incompetence.<p>

Super steve did the job seeker pages and tied the sections together.  I
recently moved to the Sacramento area and took a PHP job at a dot-com.
I also write <a href="http://tech.fojar.com/">FCS</a><p>
