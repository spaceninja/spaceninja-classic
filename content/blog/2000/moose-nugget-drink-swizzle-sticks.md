My mom just came back from Alaska with gifts for everyone. In addition to something really nice she got me and Annie, she got us "Moose Nugget Drink Swizzle Sticks." Or, in layman's terms: SHIT ON A STICK.

How am I supposed to react to this? I don't want to seem unappreciative, but she did just buy me SHIT ON A STICK.
