[Allmusic.com](http://www.allmusic.com/mus_maps.html) is a great site.

Did you know that there are only six degrees of separation between [Progressive Country](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=4:18:15|AM&sql=C108) and [Glitch Techno](http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=4:18:15|AM&sql=C11635) ?
