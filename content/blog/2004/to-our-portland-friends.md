I've gotten odd reactions from several people when they hear that Annie and I are moving on Halloween. Most are just surprised "Oh are you moving?" kind of reactions, but a couple people have actually been angry "Why didn't you tell me?" kind of reactions.

It feels like all we've been talking about for the last couple months is moving, and whether we should, and why we should, and when we should, and so on. I know I spoke about this with many people, but I guess because we didn't have a specific date, most people figured it was further in the future, or not a firm plan, and were caught by surprise when we suddenly had a date, and it was only six weeks away.

If anyone felt startled or slighted by the news, I'm sorry. It certainly wasn't my intention. Also, rest assured we're not going to be strangers. We'll be coming down probably once a month or so to see my family and get together with friends. And of course, the reverse is true - Puyallup is only about two hours away, and you're all more than welcome to come visit us.

So... is anyone available to come help us load a truck on Halloween morning? ;)
