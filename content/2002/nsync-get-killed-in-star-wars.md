So the guys in [N'Sync](http://www.neowin.net/comments.php?category=main&id=2238) have cameo roles in Star Wars Episode II. They play Jedi who get slaughtered by androids. Apparently they're on screen for about a half-second in the background of a larger shot of lots of Jedi being killed. Here's my question: Why does this bother everyone? Who _doesn't_ want to see N'Sync get slaughtered by robots?? Seems like a perfect solution to me.
