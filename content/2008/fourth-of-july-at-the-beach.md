For the fourth of July, we got Zoe dressed in her adorable little patriotic outfit and headed to the family cabin at the beach. Every year, people get their fireworks and set the off on the beach, and if you take a lawn chair down, you get a pretty good display. From the beach by our cabin, we can see the "big" fireworks display from Rockaway and have a good view quite a ways up and down the beach to dozens of other families setting off their fireworks.

It was Zoe's first time watching fireworks, and because it was so late, we were a little worried that it would freak her out. A couple hours after she went to bed, I put her in the front-pack and we all walked down to the beach. She woke up as we walked, and when we got our chairs set up, I undid the pack so I could turn her around to sit in my lap and watch. I expected that she would either get scared, or she would get excited and want to get down and play in the sand. Instead, she was just interested enough to stay awake and watch, but tired enough that she never really moved, just pointed every now and then and said "pretty."

We also got to try out the fireworks setting on our new camera, which works suprisingly well considering that we were hand-holding it instead of using a tripod.
