Well, the upgrade seems to have gone smoothly. Too early to tell yet whether this will clear up my crashing issues, but I already feel like I'm working on a leaner, smoother, cleaner installation. I also took the opportunity to do some housecleaning in my email program, and I'm down from my mail directories taking up 2 GB of disc space to around 500 MB. I could decrease that further if I quit keeping photos in my home mailbox, and got rid of some of my work archives from the last three years, but I like having everything around. Anyways, not much else to say about the upgrade except it took about 8 times longer than I expected.

I'll post soon with photos of Oskar from our visit with his last weekend.
