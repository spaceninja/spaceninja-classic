I just got this spam, and I was cracking up reading it. The broken English is, of course, hilarious in its own right, but here are some of my favorite points:

- They found your resume on "one of the job sites." No need to be specific, you'll know which one.
- They're happy to take your phone call, but don't provide a phone number.
- Having conquered the European coal market, they're expanding to the US. So presumably, you'd be selling coal here in the states, but your vacation must be taken in Poland.
