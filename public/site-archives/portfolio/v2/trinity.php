<p>The KillingMachines.org weblog community offered a variety of premade designs for their users to apply to their weblogs. This particular design was made for a blog called Trinity that was devoted to a game that combined the best features of three movies into a new uber-movie. The design was meant to imply a futuristic 3D interface, with translucent surfaces allowing the user to see through the site into other layers of data.</p>

<p>Due to a major server crash, the community has since closed, and the site is no longer available online.</p>
