> "The absolute worst thing in Matrix III was when Keanu gets to the virtual office of the Big Computer Mind, and he meets, like, a tweedy professor with a white beard. Ugh! At the very least it should have been a fat hacker in a T-shirt, preferably high on pineal extract." \-- [Rudy Rucker](http://io9.com/5065556/secrets-of-great-characters-according-to-6-science-fiction-authors)
