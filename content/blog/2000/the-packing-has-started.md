packing tally so far:

- eight paper boxes of books.
- one paper box of CDs
- two paper boxes of movies.

Yes, the packing has started. Filled out a change of address form at the post office today, gathered my stuff from the tek office, and got Shem to fill out the paperwork to terminate me. He took great pleasure in enunciating that. "Scott, I'm filling out the paperwork to TERMINATE you." Big smile on his face. I think he got almost as big a kick out of my paperwork as when he got to fill out Steve's.

Watching the _X-Men_, Magneto rips apart part of the Statue of Liberty to pin the X-men to the wall. Urn turns to me and says "Nice try, but copper's non-magnetic." A few seconds later, Magneto makes the whole scene even funnier by chastising them with the line "Honestly, I thought you people live in a school!"

Annie and I spent the night at McMenamin's Edgefield Hotel/Bar complex. It was pretty rad. Every conceivable surface has cool paintings on them, down to the water-sprinkler pipes on the ceiling, which have cute little faces painted on the pipe joints.

Our new apartment in Ellensburg is awesome. A nice two-bedroom directly across the street from our cool friends Urn and Kat, who are like duplicates of us. Urn is a computer geek in the art department with the same sense of humor and interests that I have. Kat is like Annie, right down to the back pain from a car wreck, and being short and round and cute. They both are obsessed with cute girly things like strawberry shortcake and bright colors. Kat is so excited about having Annie living across the street that she's sitting at home right this moment preparing some small potted plants to keep in our apartment. It's so much better than our current apartment. Each bedroom has a bathroom, and we're going to use the second bedroom as a library/computer room. It's on the first floor of the complex, and has a dishwasher, and a fridge with a separate freezer compartment, as well as built-in ethernet. Most excellent. :)
