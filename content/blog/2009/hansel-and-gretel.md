> "In the original story, Hansel & Gretel's stepmother persuades their father to lose them in the forest during lean times so the whole family won't have to starve. The suspicious and resourceful Hansel spoils the plot by dropping pebbles on the way in and following them home. But the next time(!) Hansel is forced to use breadcrumbs instead, which prove to be a less-than-suitable substitute since birds eat them before Hansel and Gretel can retrace their steps. Eventually the tale devolves into attempted cannibalism, grand larceny, and immolation, but basically it's a story about how unpleasant it is to be lost."
