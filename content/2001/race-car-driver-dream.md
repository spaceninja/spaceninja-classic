I had an awesome dream last night that I was a race car driver. I was driving one of those long, light-weight drag racers, and I was racing against people from the Simpsons (Mr. Burns, Nelson and Milhouse). The course seemed to be a track laid around my old elementary school. I had won several races, but I showed up just after the starting gun and had to jump in my racer and peel out to catch up with Nelson, who was laughing at me.
