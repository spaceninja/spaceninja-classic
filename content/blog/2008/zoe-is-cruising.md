Zoe is starting to see the potential of this whole "bipedal locomotion" thing. Left to her own devices, she'll still drop down and crawl wherever she needs to go, but given a willing set of hands to help her walk around, she'll start walking. She gets very excited and leans her whole body forward, so it's all her feet can do to keep up with her torso. She can't quite stand up on her own yet, but when she pulls up on the couch or in her crib, she'll happily sidestep around to get to her target (usually one of the cats on the couch, or pulling the curtains aside to peek at the backyard in her room).
