Well, I **finally** finished pulling together the all-CSS version of the [RustBucket](/2001/09/i-posted-a-new-skin/) skin. I'm very pleased with the results, and I encourage you to check it out. Ideally, you won't noticed the difference at all, but if you view the source code, you'll see there are no tables, and it uses a much cleaner set of CSS. Expect more skin work to come soon.  
  
\[aside: I also forgot how cool this aside: feature is. :)\]
