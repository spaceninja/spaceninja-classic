I was completely unproductive today, except for work-related stuff, and [this](http://www.deviantart.com/view.php?id=563576). Mom and Dad gave us their old digital camera, so I promptly took some photos of my desk and frankensteined them together. No particular reason.

Annie was also unproductive, but I helped her post scans of the embroidery she's done up on her [website](http://www.strawberrystudios.org/).
