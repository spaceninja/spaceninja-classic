Do you ever obsess over really odd things? I've been living in my apartment for about six months now, and at least twice a day, as I walk to and from school, I have to walk under a freeway overpass.

And every day, as I walk under that overpass, I imagine a truck flying off the side and squashing me like a bug.

When I have to cross the street in front of a car at a red light, I always think about how much it would suck if that car suddenly rushed forward, and how much it would hurt when the bumper connected with my knees, snapping them like twigs.

Do other people do this?
