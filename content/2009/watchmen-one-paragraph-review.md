Watchmen is great on two levels. If you've never read the comic (like Annie), it stands completely on its own as an excellent action movie with a fantastic plot. However, if you've read the comic, it's more like a love letter. Certainly, there are deviations, but Snyder has a good feel for dropping the bits that don't matter much and and adding the in-between bits that are needed to translate the story to a new format. The biggest change is the new ending, and while I think it's a bit more conventional than the comic's ending, it's certainly true to the spirit of the story, and I think the original ending probably would have alienated non-comics fans. Apart from that, however, the movie is a goldmine for attentive viewers. I've seen it twice now, and I definitely caught some bits the second time around that I missed the first time, and I can't wait for the director's cut to get more behind-the-scenes information.
