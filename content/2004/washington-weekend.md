I went to Washington over the weekend. It was kind of a last minute plan. Annie had made plans about a month ago to go up North to see family and friends the second weekend in February. I think it was kind of an arbitrary thing, though, having more to do with when she had time off work, rather than any specific plans.

So when I got email from Kat last week that Urn was having a birthday party on Saturday, and I remembered that Noah was throwing a Superbowl party on Sunday, I arranged to come up early. Sadly, Annie wasn't able to change her shifts around, so she's still going up next weekend, and I came up by myself. Dave picked me up on Friday evening, and we busted out of Portland, seeing that traffic on I-5 South was completely stopped, presumably because of a wreck. Once we got to Dave's place, it didn't take long before we had the X-Box set up, and we stayed up until about 3 AM playing Halo.

Saturday we slept in, and played Midtown Madness all morning, and then picked Rose up from work on our way to Seattle, where we met Urn and Kat and a bunch of our friends from Ellensburg at [Stellar Pizza](http://www.stellarpizza.com/). I'd never been there, before, and it was pretty cool. The whole place (as you can tell from the website) is kinda retro-themed. The best thing there was a giant poster of 50s-style spacement in jetpacks flying around in outer space. Oh, the pizza was pretty good, too.

Once Urn finished playing with the [pooping pig](http://www.gagsplus.com/toys/pigcandy.shtml) he got for his birthday, we retired to their home, where we watched Underworld. (Kat loved it, everyone else said it was "fun").

Sunday started the same as Saturday, playing Midtown Madness with Dave until we had to get in the car to go over to Noah's. Once we got there, we ate some of Juno's amazing chicken, and sat down in front of the HUGE 60 inch widescreen TV to watch the Superbowl in hi-def.

No one scored until nearly the end of the first half, but during the half-time show, a lot more people showed up, and the second half was just amazing, even for a non-football-fan like myself.

The best suprise of the morning was getting a phone call from Daniel, who was actually in Portland, but agreed to drive back to Seattle to get together with us. He and Becky showed up for the second half of the game.

After the game ended, they came back to Dave and Rose's place and we all hung out for awhile, though they had to leave pretty quickly in order to get home at a reasonable hour.

Anyways, it was a great weekend, I got to do lots of stuff, and see almost all of my friends, and we all talked about making plans to get together again soon, maybe for a party in Portland!
