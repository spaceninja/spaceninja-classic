                <b>Scott 2000</b>: Aaagh! This is so frustrating! We've been working on this for weeks and it still sucks!

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: You sure have grown up into a grouch!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: I can't believe we're calling the page Scotland. Don't you think that's a little predictable?

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: No, it's really clever! Get it? Our name is Scott…

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: No, I get it, I just think it's kinda dumb. Oh well, the title is the least of our worries. I'm starting to doubt whether I should even have a homepage.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Why's that?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: I dunno… Some of my friends think they're a waste of time.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: But it's a good place to share information with people and put up stuff you like!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: But I don't know if I want to share that stuff with people anymore. I've had a homepage since I was your age. It's moved from geocities to xoom to spaceninja, and I've never really doubted that I wanted one until now.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Well, that's why you got ahold of me, right? I'm still excited about the concept of a homepage, so you pick up on some of my enthusiasm and you're set!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Hmm. We'll see. I get excited about different stuff than I used to. Lately, I've been visiting a lot of text-only sites that get updated regularly. I really like that idea, but I don't know if I'll be able to stick to updating this site that frequently.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Why text-only? What's the appeal to that? We're artists! We like to express ourselves artistically!

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: Sure, but I've got plenty of websites to let me express myself artistically. I think I want something more from this one. I really want some content. At the same time, a minimalist homepage appeals to me. One paragraph of text… sort of an author's bio from a novel.

                <p><b>Scott 1993</b>: Now that would be boring. Where's the design? Where's the content you want? Why would anyone want to look at it?

                <p><b>Scott 2000</b>: I'm not sure. Let's work on another section of the site.
