Somehow [this little beauty](http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/curseofthegoldenflower/) escaped my notice until this weekend, which is odd, since a movie by Zhang Yimou, the guy that did House of Flying Daggers, and starring Chow Yun Fat is the kind of thing I get excited about. The plot is brutally Shakespearean, with plenty of drama, betrayal and murder. The fight scenes are great, ranging from a sword fight between the prince and the emperor (who remains seated the entire time) to impressively large battles between armies, each larger than the last. Where the movie really shines, however, is the visuals. The overwhelming attention to detail that this director possesses really comes into its own here, from the vibrant colors and luxurious style of the Imperial palace to the incredibly detailed sculpture of the emperor's gold armor. Oh, and two words: Chinese ninjas.
