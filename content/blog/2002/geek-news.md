`<GEEK NEWS>`

Oh man. I've been through the best and worst ends of computers in the last week. I've formatted my computer four times, and Annie's twice, and I still have to do it one more time because I somehow fried her hard drive.

The bad news was that all the upgrades didn't always go smoothly, and I had to swap hardware around and check support sites and call Qwest again and again and generally had a miserable time just getting things to work.

The good news is that once I get Annie's computer working again, we'll both be up and running with Windows XP (or Microsoft FisherPrice as Steve referred to it) on much faster computers.

Fry's had a fantastic sale that I caught yesterday, enabling me to upgrade my computer to an AMD Duron 950Mhz with 512MB RAM for $150. That means that Annie got my old components, giving her an Athlon 700 with 256MB RAM.

My system is fully upgraded and looking sharp. I'll get a new screenshot posted soon.

And in other news, pretty much nothing is going on in my life outside of making computers work. We did have a fun New Year's with KT and my brother Sean, though!
