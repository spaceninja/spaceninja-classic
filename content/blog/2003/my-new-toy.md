[![Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen 20GB](/images/blog-photos/nomadzen.jpg 'Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen 20GB')](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006LHO7/ref=cm_wl_ovu-pg.1-pos.2/102-8680439-7416146?v=glance&coliid=I2VTAQTYIOSW09&me=standard)"Well, I'll need to be able to play music on the honeymoon, since we're taking a long car trip." That's how I justified it to myself. ;)

What you're looking at here is my new toy. This is Creative Labs' version of the [iPod](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/71801/wo/x3cOXTiYbRtp2bdznyQZzuwCIAS/0.0.7.1.0.5.21.1.3.1.0.0.0.1.0). It's a 20 GB MP3 player they call the [Nomad Zen](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006LHO7/ref=cm_wl_ovu-pg.1-pos.2/102-8680439-7416146?v=glance&coliid=I2VTAQTYIOSW09&me=standard). The user interface isn't quite a slick as the iPod, but it's $100 cheaper, and interfaces with PCs much easier.

It's charging now. I'm very excited.
