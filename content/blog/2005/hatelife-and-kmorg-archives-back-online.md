Good news, everybody! The hatelife.org and killingmachines.org archives are back online. Now you can download an archive of your journal from either site. You'll find more information on the archive site itself, which you can access at either of the following URLs.

- [spaceninja.com/kmorg/](http://spaceninja.com/kmorg/) - Killing Machines Archive
- [spaceninja.com/hatelife/](http://spaceninja.com/hatelife/) - Hatelife Archive

If you're a hatelife fan, you should also check out the effort some former hatelifers have put into [hatelife.net](http://hatelife.net/). It's a very accurate reproduction of the early days of hatelife, and (last time I checked) they allow you to import your old hatelife entries, using the export file you get from our archive!
