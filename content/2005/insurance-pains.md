Isurance is lame. I have learned more about insurance in the last month than I ever wanted to know. I called different providers, asked questions, compared quotes online, learned about different types of insurance and learned vocabulary. And what I've learned is that insurance is lame. Terribly lame.

Renter's Insurance: The only redeeming quality here is that it's cheap - somewhere around $10-$15 per month. This is insurance that covers the belongings in your apartment. If your apartment burns down or is robbed, the insurance company will give you money to get new items to replace the things you lost. There are two types - one that covers what the item is worth, regardless of depreciation, or what it costs now, and one that covers what it will cost to replace. Also, because no one has an inventory list of everything they own, the agent has to estimate how much insurance to give you. We got $20,000 - and I have no idea if that's low or high (I suspect low).

Health Insurance: Holy God. If you don't get insurance through your work, it's EXPENSIVE. The best deal we found was through LifeWise, where we pay something like $200 or $250 per month for the two of us. Then, if anything happens, we pay differently depending on what it is. Simple things like physical checkups, annual exams, eye exams, etc. are free (to a point). Non-simple things like emergency room visits, ambulances, surgery, etc. are 70% covered, meaning we have to pay only 30% of any given bill - AFTER we pay the $1000 deductable. This means that for the first $1000 of bills for anything like that, it's not covered at all. Only after we pay the $1000 does the 70% coverage kick in. Oh, and that deductable is per-person - so that's $1000 of treatement for Annie, and $1000 of treatment for Scott. Prescription Drugs are also 70% covered - but they have a SEPARATE deductable, which is also per-person. So once again, we have to buy $1000 of prescription drugs before coverage kicks in.

Basically, this means that if you're like me, and haven't been to the doctor in years for anything major, you're paying unholy sums of money JUST IN CASE. Oh, and when that JUST IN CASE rolls around, you'll still have to pay the first $1000.

Dental: I haven't even started looking into this yet. I haven't been to the dentist in years, and I've never had troubles with my teeth, and I don't expect that I have any now - but it's been long enough that I really should be going in. But it's a whole separate bill, presumably with it's own deductables and monthly fees.

I'm telling you, if you don't get insurance through your job, you're screwed. I never realized how sweet people working at major companies have it, with low monthly payments, and deductables covered by the business and stuff like that. Businesses can afford sweet deals because they're essentially buying in bulk.

I'm not actually a fan of socialized health care, but the more I have to deal with this, the better it looks.

Now, it gets even better than all of that. Once you finally decipher all the vocabulary and sales-speak, and decide on a plan, you have to apply. The application is online - sweet! But that's misleading. Turns out that you can fill out the form online, but then you have to print it and mail it in - because you also have to turn in a 30-page health questionnaire with it (that's 30 pages per person, by the way). Page after page after page of "have you ever been treated for any of the following terrifying conditions in the last few years?"

Well, we did all that, packed it up in a giant manila envelope and mailed it off. Today we got the reply - DENIED.

Turns out they're holding Annie's back problems and treatment for depression against us. So now we get to contact her doctors, get them to write us notes explaining that none of these are outstanding issues anymore, they've all been treated and dealt with, and then we get to appeal the denial.

The guy on the phone sounded promising that we would get approved if we can show that these medical issues are non-issues, but by now I'm just about fed up. If there was some way around this, I'd jump at it.
