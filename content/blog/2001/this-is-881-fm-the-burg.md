> "Hey, this is 88.1 FM, The 'Burg, Your Music Central. It's 11:30 in the morning, I'm Obeso the Pirate, and you just heard "Come Back Down To Earth" by Luscious Jackson. Before that was "The Passenger" by Iggy Pop and "Paper-Thin Walls" by Modest Mouse. Coming up, I've got music from the Ataris, Hooverphonic and Sleater-Kinney. If you've got anything you wanna hear, you can call our request line at 963-2311, or go online at [www.881theburg.com](http://www.881theburg.com/). I've got a few quick messages before I kick you back into the music with "Judith" by A Perfect Circle, so keep it here."

I miss that. Who wants to start a radio station with me?
