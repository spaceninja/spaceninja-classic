Some of you know that Steve and I have plans to get a digital movie camera and start producing no-budget short films which we will release on the internet. The idea is to capitalize on our short attention span. Now for your viewing pleasure I present my latest concept.

### The Day I Took My Gang To The Beach

As we were leaving the beach, we saw a group of guys walking in. Now, I don't know that they were thugs, but they were dressed the part, and it made me laugh to picture a bunch of hard-ass gangstas relaxing at the beach. So my film will be about a gang, who head to the beach after some successful gang-related activities. They should all walk onto this nice, sunny family beach and mill around for a few minutes, making comments to each other like "This is a nice beach, yo." Perhaps some of them will take off their shoes and roll up their baggy pants to the knees and wade into the surf, where they stand around in ankle-deep water, trying to look hard. I think it would be a little too much to have them playing frisbee, though.
