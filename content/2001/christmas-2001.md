**Happy Holidays to everyone!**

I hope you're all having as great a time as Annie and I have had, though hopefully with considerably more sleep. We did our usual weekend with Annie's family, including Christmas Eve, and then catching an 8am train after a bleary-eyed gift exchange at 6:30am. My parents picked us up at the Portland train station at 11am, and we did the two-hour drove to Eugene to have Christmas with my family. We just got back about a half hour ago, and I thought I should post while it's still technically Christmas.

The reason I'm exhausted is because when I'm at Annie's house, her brothers (and their friends) and I all hook together some computers and engage in some inter-active video gaming! We couldn't resist the urge to get one last night of Quake III in before I left on Christmas morning, so I went to bed at 2:30am. Woo! Four hours of sleep! I'm all jittery from a mixture of lack of sleep, caffeine, cold pills, turkey and apple pie. But we had a fantastic time seeing our families and all our friends (even Urn and Pat!). Now I'm going to end this rambling post and head to bed.
