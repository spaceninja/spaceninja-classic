So, once again, I have switched to a new web host. I was using [TextDrive.com](http://textdrive.com/), and they were a good solid host, but they had two major problems. One was the horrible back-end they use (WebMin) and the other is they have some crazy mod\_rewrite thing set up which allows you to create a subdomain just by making a folder, but it also causes problems with any other mod\_rewrite things you may be doing, such as the clean URLs for WordPress.

So now, I'm using [CrazyWebHosting.com](http://crazywebhosting.com/), which comes highly recommended from my coworkers. It's a little cheaper, has better options, no crazy mod\_rewrite stuff, and uses CPanel for the back-end, so things are going well so far.

I made the switch over the weekend, and it seems to have gone without a hitch, so I'll be cancelling my TextDrive account soon, and finalizing everything.
