Zoe was a little young for the beach last year, but we've managed to take her a few times this year, and she's always very excited. She loves playing in the sand and even (with a bit of coaxing) splashing in the creek â€” though she refuses to touch the actual ocean, and when it gets too windy she wants us to hold her the whole time.

After one trip to the beach, I knew it had made a big impression when she started telling me one night about her plans: "I go to the beach! I play in the sand! I put my feet in the ocean! I splash Mama!" (this last was accompanied by uproarious laughter.)

This video is of Zoe running back to where Annie's lying in the sand after I tried to get her to walk into the ocean. You can tell she's having a great time because she's so excited that every few feet, she runs back and forth and flops into the sand.
