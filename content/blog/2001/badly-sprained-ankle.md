feeccckkk...

My ankle is now officially badly sprained, topping off the week of weirdness. I'm on light duty for 5 days and I see someone else on wed. to see if that needs to continue or not. I've got this cool brace and happy drugs for awhile and scott is taking good care of me. :)

it's so frustrating to be laid up like this, especially while my team is off on cool projects. I get to see if people need help in their offices or something... oh well, it's better to pamper my ankle now rather than have it get so bad I can't work for several months. I've got plenty of organizing and studying I can do sitting down, but I'm uncomfortable all the time and I'm mostly watching tv. bleah.

Send Hugs!
