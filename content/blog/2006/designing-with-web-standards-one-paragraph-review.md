[![Designing with Web Standards by Jeffrey Zeldman](/images/298401108_a3c16f3955_t.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/298401108/)If you want to be a successful musician, you don't just pick up an instrument and learn to play, you also study music theory. Similarly, if you want to be a successful web designer, you need to learn theory as well as code. Where most books cover code and technique, this book is the definitive guide to the theory of the web standards movement. Having co-founded the Web Standards Project during the height of the browser wars, Jeffrey Zeldman has been at this longer than most of us, and in this book, he shares his theories and best practices, along with a bit of history - like a grizzled war veteran sharing his experience. This book should be required reading for anyone looking to get involved in the web industry. (_If this book were a college course, it would be 100 level, and required to graduate._)
