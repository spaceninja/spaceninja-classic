My friendship with Steve has always been marked by odd moments of synchronicity. It should come as no suprise to anyone who has known us for any period of time that Steve and I think alike on a great many matters, but the parallels in our thoughts suprise even us. For instance, we'll not only have the same reaction to something, but we'll phrase that reaction in the exact same way, right down to pauses and enunciation. Tonight, while discussing work, we had one of these moments which I will now share with you. Keep in mind that this is from a chat program, so we're frequently typing at the same time, even though the sentences appear in order here.

> **Steve:** oh ho, pizza, brb
> **Scott:** haha I had pizza for dinner too
> **Scott:** it's that damn sychronicity again
> **Steve:** yay!!
> **Steve:** mine's just frozen, though
> **Scott:** HAHAHAHA mine too!
> **Scott:** Freschetta?
> **Steve:** mine's YES HAHAHAH
> **Steve:** freschetta! the best frozen pizza!
> **Scott:** hahaah I can't believe we had the same pizza for dinner
> **Scott:** that's hilarious
> **Steve:** that's amazing
