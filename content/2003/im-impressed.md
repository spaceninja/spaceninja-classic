Want some proof of how accurate our bombs are?

More of the satellite photos of baghdad.  
  
I'm particularly interested in seeing the placement of the oil-filled-trenches that they lit on fire (that's what the black smoke is coming from... the bombing targets are grey smears on the ground) to try to make it harder to bomb targets... and see just how ineffective a smokescreen is when we can look down from orbit.
