ZeFrank recently posted these [brilliant job descriptions](http://www.zefrank.com/jobz/), and I'm reposting them here because I don't want to lose them if he takes down the "help-wanted" page.

> **Full or Part Time Front End Developer/Interaction Designer (4+ years experience):**
> 
> Ideally you should know what the following acronyms stand for and be able to use any one of them to fix a leaky pipe in my bathroom: CSS, HTML5, PHP, AS (AS3, AS2), C++ (for mobile), and all sorts of APIs. You should know by experience that whatever you don’t understand you can learn quickly. You should be awesome at making JavaScript do things it wasn’t designed to do. You should be okay at making Photoshop do what it was designed to do. You should have sent at least one email to someone you have never met telling them that they should stop using tables. You should know how to interact with a database in a healthy, grown-up, passive-aggressive way. You should tell your coder friends that you are a designer and your designer friends that you are a coder. You should have friends but it is okay if you don’t. You should find an exhilarating beauty in finding a simple solution to a problem. The word “iterate” should roll off of your tongue like a mantra.
> 
> **Part Time Graphic Designer/Illustrator/Interaction Designer (4+ years experience):**
> 
> You should be comfortable designing anything that needs designing. The phrase “Please make that look more like a Muppet vomited SteamPunk.” should seem like satisfactory art direction, and to be honest there was no need to use the word “please”. You should feel slightly anxious when you see something that isn’t properly aligned. You should know the difference between art and design, and you should love getting into those kinds of arguments. You should feel relieved that I am kidding. You should be awesome at Photoshop and Illustrator and you should be able to use HTML and CSS well enough to defend your work against Internet Explorer. You should love to draw and know how to animate. The word cute should not offend you. You should have had a prior job that made you question your profession. The word “iterate” should roll off of your tongue like a mantra.
> 
> **Intern (6-9 months):**
> 
> All of the above should simultaneously intimidate you (at least a little) and interest you (a lot).
