Yeah, so I've been talking like Frankenstein's monster a lot... party GOOD! cold BAD!

We had an amazing party over the weekend! At the wedding and related festivities, there was mingling between our Portland friends and our Washington friends, and in particular, KT and the Washington girls.

So KT decided that we should throw a party here in Portland and get all of them to come down. This we did. We planned ahead, and decided to have a Veteran's Day party (but then had to delay it a week), and we bought prodigious amounts of alcohol, and lots of sandwich makings for food, and made up a fancy invitation.

And everyone came! Urn and Kat, Dave and Rose, Zach and Noah, Daniel and Becky, and almost all of our Portland friends, except for Eric and Jill and Sean, who were sick. The party went late, and we played games, and watched goofy film clips, and played drinking games. Daniel brought his magic camera, which takes photos of normal situations and inserts drunk girls grabbing each other's boobs into them (for reference, see the wedding photos he took).

Eventually people started passing out around 3:30am. Then we got up and 8am, and kept partying! It was a lot of fun, and I'm really glad everyone came down. Hopefully, we'll be able to do it again, before too long!

The only bad thing is that the lack of sleep and the alcohol seem to have combined to lower my resistance to the cold that's going around, and I can feel the effects starting even now. I'm trying to stay warm and drink lots of water, but it might already be too late.

Photos and stuff coming soon!

PS: Other Stuff!
It's been long enough since I posted that I've forgotten to mention the other stuff that's been happening, such as the satellite debacle (it's a long and boring story, with the end result that we're now getting cable instead). I also got to go to Seattle for a work-related conference, which was fun, but completely uninterested to anyone who doesn't work at my job, and now I remember why I didn't post any of this stuff.
