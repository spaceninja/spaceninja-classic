Alright, I got one of them done - David's family weblog is back up at [dysnomia.spaceninja.com](http://dysnomia.spaceninja.com/). I've still got some tweaks to make and some improvements for the design, but it's mostly done. Plus, I learned a few things setting up the archives, which I will retroactively apply to Rusted, so everyone wins!
