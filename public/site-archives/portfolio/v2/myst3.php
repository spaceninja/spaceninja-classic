<p>Presto! contacted me to make a series of desktop themes featuring imagery and sounds from their (then) upcoming Myst III game. The designs were to reflect a feeling of mystery and exploration.</p>

<p>In addition to the wallpaper shown here, a series of icons were designed based around books featured in the game, as well as further customizations to the Windows 98 GUI, such as folder backgrounds, cursors and a sound scheme.</p>
