Steve and I have become somewhat obsessed with our junk mail filters lately, and as a result, I find myself looking through my inbox at the spam that slipped through my filters, analyzing it for weaknesses.

The latest irritating trend that I've noticed is spam being sent from MY email address. I thought nothing of it at first, figuring it was some sort of spam trickery, to set the from address to match the address of the person reading it... but recently I received some "address rejected" letters from the servers of the people that were spammed using my email!

This pisses me off so much. Does anyone have any ideas about how I could possibly prevent someone from using my address in this way?
