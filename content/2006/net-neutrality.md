I'd seen the phrase "[network neutrality](http://www.isen.com/blog/)" getting [tossed around a bit](http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20060515), but wasn't sure what it was all about. I [looked it up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality), and while there's a lot of hyperbole on both sides of the argument, I just can't see any reason to support the COPE Act (which opposes Net Neutrality). I encourage you to [please sign the petition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality'>educate yourself</a> on the matter, and if you oppose this, <a href=).

**Followup:** I've finished my reading and have decided to sign the petition, and I'll share with you one of the biggest factors in that decision. Some of the advocates of Net Neutrality include "legal scholars Lawrence Lessig, Tim Wu, Susan Crawford and others. Most of the major internet application companies, the so-called "Group of Six," are also advocates including IAC/InterActiveCorp, Amazon, and especially Google. Microsoft has also taken a stance in support of Net Neutrality..." On the other side of the fence, opposing Net Neutrality, we have "the Bell companies and by some major cable companies. Cable operators, like Comcast have taken a somewhat mixed position -- they have repeatedly affirmed that they consider neutral networks desirable, but think regulation is a mistake."

If Qwest and Comcast think it's bad, while Amazon, Google and Laurence Lessig think it's good, that clarifies things for me quite a bit.
