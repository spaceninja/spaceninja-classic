Is it ugly? You bet!

Is it temporary? You better believe it!

I'm in the middle of the redesign, which I'm having to impliment in phases, due to the fact that I'm rebuilding all of the Movable Type templates to suit my future CSS needs. By putting a lot of work into it now, I can save myself a ton of work in the future by only having to modify the CSS file to redesign the site, never the actual HTML files.

Anyways, right now the only styling going on is some very very basic layout code, with a bit of color added for clarity. It's all going to be changing very soon.
