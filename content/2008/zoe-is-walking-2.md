Zoe started walking a few weeks ago. She'd been building up to it for quite awhile, and it's suprising how quickly it's become her primary method of getting around. For the first week or so, walking was a novelty -- a game she would play with us, or something to make people clap -- but as her stability increased, she's started crawling less and less until now she's on her feet 90% of the time.

One of the funniest things is that she waited long enough to start walking that she's very aware of her sense of balance. She doesn't faceplant very often because most of the time when she walking, if she's even a little unbalanced, she immediately drops to the floor. She'll sit there for a second, and then when she feels balanced again, she stands up and goes about her business. So most of our videos of her walking have this funny up-and-down thing going on.

These two videos were taken at the park last week, where she spent her time trucking around following Milo and Oskar, with regular detours back to the picnic blanket to get more chicken from Annie. In the first video, at the end you can hear her ask Annie for "more" and make the sign language gesture for "eat," and in the second video, as she walks away at the end, you can hear her say "bye-bye" without looking back.
