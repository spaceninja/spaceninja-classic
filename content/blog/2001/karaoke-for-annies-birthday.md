Last night was Annie's birthday, so she decided that she wanted to go out to a place called the Java Jive. Despite the name and the fact that the place is housed in a building shaped like a coffepot, it's a bar. An incredibly small bar with an overwhelming amount of tacky decorations everywhere and graffiti on every surface. In short, the kind of place Annie loves. She pointed out to me that even though the bartender told her not to, she wrote something on the wall as a tribute to her friend Stacy, who died recently. Oh, and did I mention that it was a karaoke bar? Fortunately, most people sang either rock ballads (_Every Rose Has A Thorn_) or country songs that I didn't know. But just so I wouldn't feel left out, they ruined a few songs that I do like, including _The Devil Went Down To Georgia_, _The Humpty Dance_, and several Johnny Cash songs. Thankfully, they discovered that the CD with Depeche Mode's _Personal Jesus_ had a scratch on it before I was forced to commit murder.

**Things I learned last night:**

- Karaoke bar people think that what you lack in singing talent you can make up for in volume.
- Karaoke bar people have bad taste in music.
- Some people really do need killin'.
- I can only pray that when I die, my friends care enough about me to deface a drinking establishment in my name.
- Annie and I have very different tastes in interior decoration.
- The only way I would ever, under any circumstances, do karaoke is if Steve and I got on stage to perform _Stand By Your Man_.

**Things I will learn soon:**

- Posting jokes about your girlfriend's favorite things is a bad idea.
