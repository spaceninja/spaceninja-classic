Right now, I am thinking seriously about blatantly copying the site layout and design sense from [Dooce](http://www.dooce.com/). In addition to loving her designs and content, I love the way she set up the "thinking" "feeling guilty for" "enjoying" sections along the sidebar. ...I probably won't, but every time I look at her site, I feel jealous.
