I was a bit nervous when I heard that the Bond franchise was being rebooted, and that the new version of Casino Royale would be about a young James Bond as a newly-minted "Double-Oh" agent. However, my concerns were completely misplaced. The new movie is a nearly flawless blend of action, stunts, and spy drama, without relying on cheesy villains or gadgets. The tone for the movie is set early on when Bond is chasing a [Parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour)\-trained baddie through a construction park. The bad guy does a complicated leap into the air through a tiny window set near the ceiling, and Bond follows by running straight through the newly-hung drywall.
