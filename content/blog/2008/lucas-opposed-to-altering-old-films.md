> Lucas recently spoke out against companies altering old films and colorizing black and white features; he claimed that, as a proponent of history, viewers should be able to appreciate a film as it was originally released. “I am very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films that I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved, so that my children can see them,” he said a few years ago. Perhaps he should re-examine his beliefs. \--Michael Kaminski, [How the Grinch Stole Star Wars](http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/specials/how-the-grinch-stole-star-wars.php)
