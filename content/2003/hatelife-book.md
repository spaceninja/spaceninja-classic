Because I'm fascinated with the idea of a hatelife book, I've begun compiling a list of classic hatelife entries, each of which would occupy a page in the book (regardless of length). If you're interested in helping, please reply to this post with the name of the journal and a direct link to the post in question, like so:  
  
Drew's Robot Arms  
\[http://hatelife.org/s/733\]  
  
Obeso "One time I peed on a guy."  
\[http://hatelife.org/s/8465\]  
  
Blackflag gets stung by a scorpion  
\[http://hatelife.org/s/21819\]  
  
Chickenfinger and the hog that couldn't stand up  
\[http://hatelife.org/s/269\]  
  
These are just examples, obviously. Thare are many more to include... For instance, I haven't even begun to tap the [atrocious](http://hatelife.org/v/atrocious) or [stacy](http://hatelife.org/v/Stacy) goldmines. So make your suggestions!
