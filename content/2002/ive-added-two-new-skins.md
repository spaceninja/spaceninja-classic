I've added two new skins to the site. You can access them on the [Viewing Options Page](http://rusted.killingmachines.org/cookie.php) as usual. One is called **Old School Terminal** and is a monospaced green font on a black background design with a slick little ASCII-art title. The other is called **Blue Bucket**, because it's a blue version of the RustBucket skin. It comes in two flavors: normal and widescreen. Check them out!

**Edit 10/26/2005:** The options page has been discontinued.
