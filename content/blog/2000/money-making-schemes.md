I love the way Fojar floats from one money-making scheme to another. None of them ever really fail, it's just that when they prove to be unprofitable after a week, development is halted to focus on the next idea. Disadvantage: Possibly our short attention span is preventing us from ever fully-developing any idea to its maximum potential. Advantage: Short attention span leads to a great deal of experimentation and learning processes, not to mention that it's a lot of fun.

What's that? You want some examples? Well, the earliest I remember was trying to get someone to pay Steve to do Pokey. Never took off due to Steve's feeling of compromised artistic values. Then there was the time that Fojar was going to become a major ISP, and we were going to make all the money we needed from selling accounts and web design. Most recently, there's A1-Super, which should make us rich any day now, when we sell 3000 subdomains, the space ninja store, the banners, which we're currently plotting to get major banner ad places to pay us to have, and FCS, which as far as I know, has not yet sold a single copy.

Are any of these bad ideas? Not at all! Most of them (FCS especially) are fantastic ideas, and I really think they have potential. But when you've heard Steve say "If we can just sell 1000 accounts, which I don't think is unreasonable, we'd be set!" over twenty times, you begin to take it with a grain of salt.

To quote Miles, "THAT'S THE FOJAR WAY," and I for one wouldn't have it any other way. Well, maybe have it the same way, but actually sell something. ;)
