I almost forgot to post this... Kat agreed to buy me lunch today. I walked back to the table with the lunch tray containing both my lunch, kat's lunch and Urn's lunch. When I set it down, Eric, Jill and Annie all looked at the tray, and looked and me. Annie said: "Jeezus, Honey! That's a lot of food!"

I paused for a moment, not really believing it. "It's not all for me!" Perhaps Obeso the Pirate wasn't the smartest name choice in the world, but it stunned me... Did they really think that I could eat four large burritos, two sodas, a hostess snack cake and a bag of sour apple rings? Come on!
