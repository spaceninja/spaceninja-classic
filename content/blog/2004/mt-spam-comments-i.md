Well, it's started. MT is a common enough system that people have written automated spammers for the comment system, and I've already started getting some comment spam here on Rusted.

The new version of MT is supposed to address this, but in the meantime, there's [a few things](http://cheerleader.yoz.com/archives/000849.html) I can do to discourage it on my own, which I'll probably impliment over the next couple of days.
