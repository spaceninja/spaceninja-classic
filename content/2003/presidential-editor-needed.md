> \[Regarding the bombings in Saudi Arabia,\] President Bush vowed to hunt down the attackers: "These despicable acts were committed by killers whose only faith is hate, and the United States will find the killers, and they will learn the meaning of American justice." [\*](http://apnews.excite.com/article/20030513/D7R0HLSO1.html)

Is anyone even bothering to proofread the president's speeches anymore? We don't need to find the _killers_, and teach them "American Justice" (Don't get me started on that) ...THEY WERE SUICIDE BOMBERS. Their bodies were lying in the street next to their blown-up cars. You don't need to find _them_, you need to find **the people who SENT them**.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I'm appalled by the bombings, and I think we should try to find the people responsible for it. But come on! Will someone please at least glance at this man's notes before he's allowed to address the public?
