As any of my friends can tell you, I tend to be an optimist when it comes to the government. I want to believe they have our best interests at heart. But all this news about Bush proposing a constitutional ban on gay marriage terrifies me. I have no problem with Bush opposing gay marriage. But when he starts actively taking steps to remove rights from a group of people, even I start to get alarmed. It's worth noting that this is a move so repugnant to the American people that it has only happened once before, and as Jon Stewart said, we all remember how well the Prohibition worked out.

Anyways, I've edited this post several times now, and I'm still not happy with my attempts to put my feelings on this into words, so I'm going to quote two other people who have done it much better than me.

> "Sometimes I think the greatest hindrance to our cause is the sheer force of the American legend. So strongly do people believe this country stands for freedom that they can't fathom it's ever otherwise. Sign a few contracts, the well-intentioned advise, and you'll get all the same rights as straight couplesâ€”that's an outrageous fiction, but not as outrageous as the notion that being almost equal under the law is good enough."

> "George Bush has proposed that we use the federal Constitution to take rights away from a group of Americans. Think about that. Lon and his boys wanted to mess with the state constitution to equate people like me with pedophiles. Bush wants to go further. Last I looked, there's no law preventing pedophiles from getting married--as long as they're heterosexual."

Despite my apprehesions about the president, I've been very happy to see that Oregon is one of the few places in the country that's actively supporting gay marriage. Even Benton County, who were forced to stop issuing same-sex marriage certificates to avoid the attourney general coming after them, managed to avoid completely reversing their stand on the issue by not issuing _any marriage certificates_ to anyone, gay or straight. Their reasoning is that if the certificates apply to everyone, then a cease order applies to everyone as well. It's not as good as continuing to issue them, but it's at least still a way to recognize the county's stance on the issue.

> "The commissioners have drawn some criticism for refusing to issue any marriage licenses until the gay marriage question is settled in court. Jaramillo said that withholding licenses from opposite-sex couples is consistent with the commissioners' previous decision to recognize the rights of all people to get married. Benton County residents can still get married here, the commissioners said. They would just need to drive to Albany or another county seat to obtain a license. 'Please be patient,' Jaramillo asked of anyone who would be inconvenienced by the decision."
