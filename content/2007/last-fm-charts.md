What you're looking at here is one small slice of a waveform graph of my music listening habits over the last year, as recorded via [last.fm](http://last.fm/). I generated this using the service at [LastGraph](http://lastgraph.aeracode.org/), which makes it super easy by just giving your last.fm username and a date range. The guy who made LastGraph, Andrew Godwin, based it heavily on an original concept by [Lee Byron](http://megamu.com/lastfm/). If you've got a last.fm account, this is pretty cool. It's attractive enough to print up as a poster, and the individuality of the results are neat. My favorite part is how you can easily see when I was really into a particular artist by the size of their "island."
