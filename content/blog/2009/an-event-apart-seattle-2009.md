[![An Event Apart Seattle Title](/images/3513984450_4bcfc66020.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/3513984450/)

The night before [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com/), I was at a party with some college friends. When they found out I was in town for a conference, they wanted to know what it was about. I said it was a web conference, and they said "Aren't those usually held on the web?"

Eventually, I explained it like this: You know how in every industry, there are the A-List people? The real movers and shakers who influence everyone? In the web design world, those people are [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/) and [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://zeldman.com/), and An Event Apart is their conference.

This was my fourth time, and it just gets better every time. The quality of the speakers, and the breadth of the material being presented simply blows away every other web conference. If you are at all involved in the web industry, whether as a designer, a developer, a copywriter, or even a project manager, I cannot recommend An Event Apart strongly enough. Guaranteed, you will learn a lot, and come back recharged about your work.

I was going to write a huge post with details about all the speakers, but to be honest, the very idea exhausts me â€” and if I don't want to write it, there's no way you'll want to read it. Instead, if you're interested in reading more, [Russ from Think Brownstone](http://www.thinkbrownstone.com/blog/?p=342) wrote a review perfectly summarizing why An Event Apart is the best web conference available. He also shares my opinion that single-track conferences are better than multi-track ones.
