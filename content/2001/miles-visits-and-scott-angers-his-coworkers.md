Time: 3:48am (press return). Miles has just left my house. Around 9pm tonight (yesterday) Annie checked out a car, and we picked up Miles and Zach (and KT) at KT's house. On the way to Gustav's, Miles started telling a story about his housemates which he was only able to finish by the time we left Gustav's two hours later. We dropped KT off, and Miles suggested renting _The Original Kings of Comedy_, which we all watched at my house, and were greatly amused by. We had a great time, and were sad to see Miles go. Zach asked if he could crash here for the night, which we agreed to, and I said he could sleep in the middle bedroom (where our computers are set up) after I checked my email.

Now Zach is sleeping in the basement, and I'm still sitting at my computer because I have work to do. I knew this might happen, since Steve and I had a demo assigned to us at a meeting today, which is due tomorrow (today) at 9am (5 hours from now). But since Miles was only in town for one day, I decided to hang out with him and run the risk of coming home to a pile of work needing to be done.

Now I'm facing the same decision I faced so many times in college: With five hours until the project is due, is it better to work now and get three hours of sleep at the end, or sleep now and get up in three hours to do the work? Or is it better to post to KillingMachines and avoid the decision altogether?
