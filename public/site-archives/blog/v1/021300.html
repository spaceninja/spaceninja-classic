<br>Sorry for so long since the last update, but I've been busy with my ninja training. I've been spending all my time lately convincing the school that I am, in fact, capable of graduating. They've got these strange ideas about it taking "effort" and "work" to graduate. I'm trying to convince them that the qualities of "bullshitting" and "laziness" are worth much more in real world. Oh well. Soon, they'll see the error of their ways, and then they'll be sorry. It's funny to think that somewhere, right now, some sucker just missed the greatest episode of <i>Futurama</i> and <i>X-Files</i> because they were "studying" so they could "pass their classes." Heh. Chumps.

<p>But don't think that I haven't been productive, because I have! Oh, yes. Behold the launch of my online web comic, Hammerspace! It's my shameless attempt to cash in the rather popular fad among my two friends of having comics. Between Pokey and Isometric, I was feeling very left out. So I decided to make my own comic. It's done in Final Fantasy style and has naked chicks in it. Check it out at <a href="/site-archives/hammerspace/v2/">hammerspace.fojar.com</a>.

<p>We all (meaning everyone that I work with and hang out with) went to Shem (my boss)'s party last night. It was great. Nice techno music, beautiful house, lots of food, lots of people, loud conversations. After the party, I downloaded all the MP3s of Pink Martini from our server, because we were listening to them at the party. It was funny, because Annie and KT both came with me, and no one knows them, so they both introduced themselves as being "with Scott," but KT kept having to clarify that she wasn't my girlfriend. Then she started confusing people by announcing that she's Miles' roommate, which Miles has agreed to, but hasn't actually happened yet, and it's occured to me that this story isn't nearly as amusing now that I'm relating it to you as when it was happening.

<p>Highlights of the evening: KT getting tackled by one of her professors demanding to know which student has a crush on her, the revealing by one of our co-workers girlfriends that he has a "retarded tattoo" of a scorpion with two left pincers on his back, and Annie falling asleep two hours before we left on the couch.
