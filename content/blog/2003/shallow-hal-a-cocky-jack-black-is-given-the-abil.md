**Shallow Hal** - A cocky Jack Black is given the ability to see people's inner beauty, rendering Gwyneth Paltrow in an awkward fat suit into an awkward Gwyneth Paltrow.

**2001: A Space Odyssey** - Astronaut Dave Bowman, sole survivor of a secret mission to Jupiter, deactivates the ship's homicidal onboard computer and then is eaten by aliens and reborn as a giant, freaky space-baby.

**Phone Booth** - A cocky Colin Farrell is held hostage by a madman with a rifle when he picks up a ringing telephone in the last phone booth left in Manhattan. Dumbass.
