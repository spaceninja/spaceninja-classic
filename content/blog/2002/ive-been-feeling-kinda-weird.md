I've been feeling kinda weird lately. I use what little productivity I have at work, and by the end of work, I just feel drained and don't want to do anything but sit on the couch and watch TV. And I don't even really want to do that, it's just that requires no effort.

\*blarg\*

Time to get off my lame ass and accomplish some of the stuff on my to-do list that I've been meaning to do for a long time.

Footnote: Thanks for your helpful posts, everyone! I feel a lot better now. After I posted that, I spent the whole day cleaning. That might not sound like the biggest accomplishment, but it makes me feel much better about my surroundings, and it's also something with definite results. I cleaned, now it is clean. Stuff on the computer tends to have more abstract results, and so sometimes it's hard to feel like I've accomplished anything.
