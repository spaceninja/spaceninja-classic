The guys over at [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) have posted [the Survey for People Who Make Websites 2008](http://alistapart.com/articles/survey2008). Despite the awkward name, this survey is worth your time if your job has anything whatsoever to do with the web. The results from [last year's survey](http://alistapart.com/articles/2007surveyresults) were really interesting, and now that they've refined the questions a bit, this year's should be even more informative.

> Calling all designers, developers, information architects, project managers, writers, editors, marketers, and everyone else who makes websites. It is time once again to pool our information so as to begin sketching a true picture of the way our profession is practiced worldwide.

> [This year’s survey](http://alistapart.com/articles/survey2008) corrects many of last year’s mistakes, with more detailed and numerous questions for freelance contractors and owners of (or partners in) small web businesses. There are also better international categories, and many other improvements recommended by those who took the survey last year.
