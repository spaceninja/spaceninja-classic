We picked Ryan, Molli and Leilani up from the airport on Monday night, and hung out with them at my parents' house. Unfortunately, I forgot my camera, so once again, photos are forthcoming (once I get them from Dad). Suffice to say, Leilani is insanely cute. She got off the plane and was beaming as they walked up to us with her stroller. She was laughing and waving and her happiness was catching.

Once we got back to my parents' house, we all watched Leilani run at full tilt all over the house, dig into things, pick things up, put things down, hand things to people, and run full tilt down the stairs, where some panicked adult would catch her.

It's still a little hard to believe that Ryan and Molli are finally here. But it's harder to beleive how insanely cute their daughter is. I'll have to take a few movie files of her, because photos just aren't doing it justice (not that you even have any of those to go by, but trust me).

Aside from that, I have made plans with Sean and Aaron (and Colin, when he moves back to town) to start up a weekly game day to get together and play Necromunda. It's sad how excited I am about this. What can I say, I love tabletop war games.

House cleaning continues at a depressingly slow pace - Yesterday I picked up all the yard debris from our driveway, where we tore all the viney weeds off the fence, which may not have been a good idea, as that seems to be all that was holding the fence up... it sags alarmingly now at odd angles.

I still need to call Jill and confirm plans to start driving on a regular basis so I can get off my ass and get my driver's license, so I don't drive Annie nuts by making her drive me places when we get our car.

And, as always, there's the server, staring at me from the office, daring me to attempt to fix it. I hate it a little more with every day that passes, so I need to get it done soon, before I lose motivation to do it at all. Maybe tonight I'll do it. It might help if I imagine myself fixing the server as Doctor Frankenstein, hoisting my server to the heavens, waiting for the bolt of lightning to bring my creature server to life. Maybe I can borrow a big white smock and black rubber elbow gloves from someone.
