Since Ryan moved in, L visits nearly every weekend, and Zoe has been thrilled. For the most part, they get along great, and Zoe loves having a "big sister" to follow around and play games with. She gets super excited on Saturday mornings, and has a hard time waiting for L to wake up. Usually, I take her downstairs to watch some videos until it's time for second breakfast. When L opens the door from upstairs, she always has a big grin on her face, because she knows that Zoe is going to jump up and run over, shouting "L\*\*\*\*\*\*!!"
