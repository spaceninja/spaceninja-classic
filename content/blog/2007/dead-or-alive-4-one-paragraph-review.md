On the original xbox, one of the best games for parties was Dead or Alive 3. Something about the combination of the tag team mode with the over-the-top characters just made it fun to watch, and even more fun to play. Even a button masher like myself stood a decent chance of winning a round. With the exception of Halo, this was the game we got the most replay value out of, so it was only natural that I pick up the sequel when I got my 360. I'm happy to say that this is, with a few minor improvements, exactly the same game, but with better graphics, some new characters, and some cool new scenery. The new stuff is all great, but I have to say that the single coolest feature about this version is the ability to unlock a Spartan from the Halo series as a playable character. Nothing quite like watching a fight between a heavily armored scifi warrior and Bruce Lee.
