Since lots of people seem to be ending up here wondering where Hatelife is, let me give you a brief explanation:

- Steve appears to have removed hatelife from his server.
- Miles tells me that Steve is transferring the domain to Miles' name.
- Miles intends to put hatelife back the way it was.
- **No one's journals are lost forever.**

There will be a slight delay while the DNS changes go through and Miles puts the site back up. So before anyone else tries to post a guilt trip or angry comments here, let's just be clear about one thing. None of the people on this site had anything to do with what happened to hatelife. In fact, one of the people on this site is working to restore it. So you might want to think before venting your spleen at him. I can't speak for Miles, but if I started taking shit from the hatelife community for Steve's actions, my desire to restore the site would quickly disappear.

Just be cool, and the site will return shortly.

**UPDATE:** See [this post](/2004/07/hatelifeorg/) for information about the hatelife archive.
