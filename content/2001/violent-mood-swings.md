so in accordance with the violent mood swings on this site, everything is much better than the last post. Scott and I are moving into an amazing duplex on saturday and my ankle is recovering nicely. finally. I go to the doc again on friday and hopefully I'll be able to go back to work. I don't know though because I still have 4 more physical therapy appts. who knows. I'm just happy it doesn't hurt every time I walk now...I'm still pretty slow but at least I'm more balanced.

I also found out about a cool thing the library does, for two bucks, you can have books sent to your house! I was online and in pain so I said hey why not? now I have feminist books coming to the door so I don't even have to leave the kitchen. ;)

also this week I realized something cool. I ask people "how was work? how was your day?" ans they say "oh you know...same old same old...work.." and I realized that since I've been in Envirocorps I've never said that. Even though I have to get up early in the morning, almost every day I've been up and ready to go. I always come back with new information and stories to tell. I think that's really important. (did I mention that my new place is within two blocks of work?) haha. there's also two cute coffee places, a burrito place, a huge music store, a convenience store and a theater/pub within like five or six blocks. there are also 4 cars within walking distance that I can check out from Flexcar. we rock. It's scary how I could go on and on about our new place but I won't...

I'm so excited to see all my babies next week. I've got the twins and Jordan to visit, and Eric and Jill are bringing Gavin over and spending the night. It's going to be awesome...oh yeah, and thanksgiving too...I know what I'm thankful for! babies!!! someday I'll have my own...it's so much fun being a crazy auntie though :)
