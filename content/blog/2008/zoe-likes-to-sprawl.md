[![Zoe sleeping on Momma](/images/2314058867_f74c8679b3.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/2314058867/)

Sometimes Zoe wakes up at 4 or 5am, and Annie is nice enough to take her downstairs so she doesn't wake me up. Usually when my alarm goes off, I will find them both asleep on the couch. This morning, though, Zoe had sprawled out backwards across Annie's leg, with one foot up on her chest, and I had to document it.
