I finally finished all the little tweaks and changes I've been meaning to do for [Leilani's weblog](http://leilani.spaceninja.com/blog/), which I've started posting photos to, and I encourage other family members to do as well.

I also learned a few little things about the templates while I was setting things up, which I will apply to the other blogs I have set up. Next up: Design work for [KT's blog](http://kt.spaceninja.com/).
