Sometimes weeks and weeks will go by, and [Yellow Number Five](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/yellow5/v2/) will receive no attention whatsoever. The occasional fan mail will trickle in, but mostly nothing.  
  
Then every now and then, I'll get an email from [Sister Machine Gun](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/yellow5/v2/sistermachinegun.html) or [Pet Of The Future](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/yellow5/v2/petofthefuture.html) wondering how they ended up on a compilation album without hearing about it.  
  
It never ceases to amaze me how easy it is to mislead people on the internet. Even with something as blatantly false as Y5! It will be interesting to see if getting some sound samples from [Zach](http://www.fojar.com/~chaz/fd/) will fool even more people.  
  
I love the internet. :)

**Edit 10/26/2005:** We no longer control the fojar domain name, so the link to zach's website is dead.
