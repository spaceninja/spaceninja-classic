mmm... real food.

i haven't eaten real food in probably a month. i just started again, slowly, over the weekend. the past month has been a period of fasting for me, brought on by the interminable stress of the big financial question mark (eg, am i gonna get any money at all for my efforts, or will i leave california completely broke?)..

this is not something i'd recommend to anyone. waking up in the morning, drinking juice and maybe eking down a piece of dry toast but more likely nothing, and then waiting all day long in a kind of daily-business paralysis to hear some news (good or bad, either way would've been nice).. you of course don't want to drive your car to exciting places to meet interesting people when, if it broke down or even just needed a petrol-refill, you likely wouldn't be able to afford it.

but i got some money today, and more should be on its way soon (wednesday?).. mailed off my rental app at the 735 st clair, too.

let's keep our fingers crossed, knock on wood, toss the salt over the proper shoulder, etc- and hope things will settle out soon :)
