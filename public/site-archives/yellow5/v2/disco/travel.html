<big>Travelling Without Moving - Arrakis Records</big>

<P>Released in 2000 on Arrakis Records, this demo CD was the first work to be released by the newly-reformed group Yellow Number Five. After the costly court battle where Dr. Colossus sued his former bandmates for possession of the band name, Colossus reformed the group with famous Norwegian remix artists J&ouml;rg Besson and Franka Kurtz. Widely heard and in high demand due to the publicity of the court case, the CD is difficult to obtain now. It contained two mixes of Suzanne Vega's song "Pipe Dream," one in which Vega's vocals were retained, and one in which Franka's vocals were used instead.
