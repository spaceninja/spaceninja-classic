Annie and I have found our apartment! It's a nice little one-bedroom on Hawthorne with hardwood floors and really nice floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room. It faces the street, but it's set back from the sidwalk up a little grass slope, so it's not like we'll have people right outside our windows.

This is just a little mockup I threw together in the Sims. It's not super-accurate, but it's enough to give you an idea of the floorplan. You come in out of the hallway into a little entryway, which opens onto the living room. On the far wall, there's the door to the bedroom, the kitchen in the middle, and then the bathroom off another little entryway/nook. It's not a giant apartment, but the layout is nice, and makes it feel bigger than it is.

Plus, being right on Hawthorne means that we've still got easy access to all the bits of the city we like, including a McMenamins pub across the street, my comic shop about 10 blocks away, and just a quick hop in the car over to the Laurelhurst theater.

We're moving in on Sunday the 4th, which is also the day my internet is getting turned on, so we'll be able to move right in and settle in without having any interruption in services.

Annie's pretty excited, and so am I. It will be nice to be back into our own place, and also it will be nice to be living together again. It made sense for her to stay up there this month, but I'll be glad when we're back in the same place.
