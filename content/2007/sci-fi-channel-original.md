That's the first ten minutes of Sean's and my _completely original idea_. Of course, it's all just laying the groundwork for the movie we really want to film: **Manaconda II: _Snake in the City_**. He's a hard-boiled homicide detective on the streets of New York, investigating a string of snake-related crimes.
