I just got off the phone with Network Solutions and found out that the troubles we were having with transferring spaceninja.com to joker were simply due to bad contact information. So hopefully I'll be able to get the transfer underway very soon.

I've been applying for jobs all over the place. I'm going to give myself a month to find a tech-related job, and then I'm going to suck it up and just get a job anywhere. Retail work is better than unemployment.

Not much else going on, really. It's nice that Sean works at the movie theater so I can see lots of movies even though I'm almost completely broke. Last night was bad action movie night. Sean and I went to see _the Mummy Returns_ and _Tomb Raider_, and I swear they used the same special effects company. In both movies, all the bad guys crumble into dust when shot, both movies feature an odd key-thing, and both movies have busty actresses. Not that I'm complaining.

Still, I'm looking forward to Annie's visit this weekend, and going to see KT after that. I've got lots of projects to work on, but I'm itching for social interaction. Steve is too lazy to let me drag him out of the house every day, and even if I did, I don't have any money to do anything. Just another reason to get a job, I guess.
