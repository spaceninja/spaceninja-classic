i finally got dsl!! fast downloads, no dialing up to the internet, etc. now we can finally get these old projects we've been talking about forever off the ground..!

i miss you, stephanie. i can't wait to see you again :)

by the way, now that there is no dearth of content, let us try to refrain from posting _every little thing that pops into our heads_, eh ryan? \*glare\*
