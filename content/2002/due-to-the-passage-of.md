Due to the passage of [some Senate bill](http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/100102/index.asp), which changes the anti-webcasting rules in some way I don't really understand, [SomaFM](http://somafm.com/) is broadcasting again! Check them out! They've got 128 Kbps streams, but I can tell you that the 56 Kbps streams aren't noticably worse, because I have to listen to them during the day, due to limited bandwidth. Steve really digs their [Secret Agent](http://somafm.com/recent/?secretagent) broadcast, but the poorly-recorded james bond quotes between songs usually just bug me. Personally, I listen to [Groove Salad](http://somafm.com/recent/?groovesalad) most of the time.
