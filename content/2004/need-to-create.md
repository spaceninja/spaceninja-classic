Did everybody hear that I got a new job? I have been looking for a second job since I got the pizza job, and I had a good interview at this futon place near my parents' house, and the owner offered me a job!

I'll be getting near full-time hours, a pretty set schedule, and health insurance!

Yes, _Health Insurance_!! And I'll be able to to add Leilani for not too much per month, so she'll have insurance!

Hoo-ray!!

. . . however, now that I'm not spending every waking moment obsessing over when I'll finally get a stable job situation, two things have become apparent . . . The things that have become apparent:

1. I'm going to miss the pizza job. I'm not quitting, I just asked my boss to take me off the schedule, and call me whenever he's desperate for an extra hand. But I liked it there, and I liked the energy, and now I'll have one shift a week at the most.

I especially liked my boss. We spent a good 45 minutes of my interview discussing the kind of manager he tries to be, and it was pretty much exactly what I've always felt a manager should be, and what I would try to be if I were a manager. And I just found out last night that he has an identical twin brother.

2. I need to Create.

With the loss of Killingmachines, I have lost my main creative outlet: constantly tweaking my journal skin. I want to focus that energy into redesigning and fabulous-izing my website, but first I have to find some new hosting . . . Scott offered to let me keep my space on his server, but somehow that just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. I don't know, it's not an issue with Scott or anything, but I kind of feel like I should start making my page more of a personal thing, and securing my own webspace seems like the right place to start.

As I put it to Scott: I'm kind of looking forward to rebuilding everything from scratch.

I also had something of an epiphany recently, which was that I realized I've spent years struggling to come up with a decent way to meld my personal webpages and my writing page into a single entity, and never could. The new solution? Stop trying. Soon, I will have not one, not two, but three pages to admin over (my new personal page/blog, Leilani's blog, and the Press). I like that. Three's a good number for me.
