Sorry for the silence lately. With the move, and the unpacking, I haven't had a lot of energy left over for internet stuff. We're at the frustrating part of unpacking where it doesn't feel like we're making any progress at all, just moving boxes endlessly from one end of the apartment to the other. It's strange, moving puts you in this odd fight-club like dual mentality. On the one hand, I like my stuff, and on the other hand, there's a LOT of it, and you can't help but wonder if it's weighing you down.

Still, we are (slowly) digging ourselves out from under all of our stuff. We got some bookcases at Ikea (continuing the fight-club theme), and once those are up, it will really help, since the only real boxes left are of books. There will still be work to be done, but it will feel more managable. I am so tired of seeing nothing but cardboard in our apartment.

On the web front, I'm still eyeing my to-do list with anticipation. Very soon, I want to get [hammerspace](https://archives.spaceninja.com/hammerspace/v2/) overhauled and start posting new comics on a semi-regularly basis, as well as a complete overhaul of spaceninja.com.

And, because I know everyone is obsessed with the question, there's nothing to report yet on the work front. I've applied with Filter again, and I'm just waiting to hear back from them. Similarly, Annie is all applied with her nanny agency and should have work soon.

Oh, also, we're getting kittens! Annie knows a family up North who have two little black kittens they have to get rid of because the guy has allergy problems. They're adorable, and we're bringing them down this coming weekend. So excited! This brings me one step closer to completely changing spaceninja.com into a cat blog.

Heh. Annie is already in bed, and just asked what I was doing. When I told her, she asked "Are you totally blogging this?"

I'm definitely having troubles sleeping lately. Not to start in on the whole "old man" school of thought, but my body is getting to the point where it thrives on routine. When I break that routine by eating at odd times or staying up particularly late, I really end up paying for it later... and in the last few weeks I've been eating and sleeping at all sorts of odd hours. I would probably do best to just impose a schedule on myself and act as if I had a day job, as much as I hate that idea. I want to enjoy my freedom while it lasts, but my body seems to feel that there may be such as thing as too much freedom.
