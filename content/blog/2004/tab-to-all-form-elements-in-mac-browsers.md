I love my mac. I love how much better and easier the operating system is than my PC. But one thing that's been bugging me since I made the switch was an infuriating flaw in mac browsers. In both Safari and all versions of Mozilla, when you use your keyboard to tab through a form, it only tabs to text fields. Any drop-down menus, checkboxes, or radio buttons are skipped.

This probably wouldn't bother most people, but I spend all day at work filling out web forms, to test out our registration system. Being able to fill out a form entirely using the keyboard is not a preference, it's a requirement, both for speed and sanity.

That's why I was so happy to stumble over these two articles today:

1. [macosxhints - Tab to all form elements in Mozilla](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20021202064800884 'macosxhints - Tab to all form elements in Mozilla') - By simply adding one line to your users.js file in your mozilla directory, tab will now exhibit the proper behavior, and you can tab to drop-down menus and radio buttons again. Note that this also works fine in Firebirdfox.

2. [xlab - Full Keyboard Access in Safari 1.2](http://www.xlab.co.uk/macosx/read/185 'xlab - Full Keyboard Access in Safari 1.2') - The latest version of Safari offers the same fix. Unfortunately, you have to get the upgrade to OS 10.3 in order to get Safari 1.2, but from all the reviews I've heard, that's worth doing anyways. I'm going to get Annie to buy me a copy with her student discount before she graduates.
