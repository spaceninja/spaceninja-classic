I'll keep this short, since this will be of no interest to anyone other than myself, but the redesign is nearly done. It's not really a redesign, per se, more a code cleanup to prepare for a redesign. It's like scrubbing and sanding a wall before you paint it. It's not interesting work, and you don't feel like you've accomplished much, but it makes things much easier for the next step.

What I've done is taken the template that [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/) ships with, and hacked away at it until I got the XHTML that it outputs much closer to what I want to see. This involved pruning extraneous bits of code, renaming certain divs and changing some HTML to be more standards-compliant and semantic.

As you can see, I've already slapped my previous CSS design back into place. (If you can't see that, hit Refresh/Reload in your browser to update the stylesheet.) It's already fitting pretty well, but there are a couple of rough spots that I'll have to finish sanding down before I have the site well primed for the new design I have in mind.

Once I'm done with the new design, I'm also going to put up a basic stylesheet switcher to allow users to choose which design they want to see.
