After jumping through every hoop they threw at me, Annie and I got approved for the apartment in Puyallup.

What's that? You say I never mentioned anything about this? Oh. Well, Annie and I are moving. To [Puyallup](http://www.ci.puyallup.wa.us/), Washington. It's pronounced Pyoo-Allup, and it's a little [East of Tacoma](http://www.google.com/url?oi=map&sa=X&q=http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp%3Fcountry%3DUS%26address%3D%26city%3DPuyallup%26state%3DWA), a bit South of Seattle, and a ways North from Portland.

We're getting a nice two-bedroom apartment, which will serve as a base of operations for Annie to get a job, and to apply for a mortgage to buy a house. The apartment is on the second floor and has a fireplace and balcony and in-apartment washer and dryer. It's smaller than our current place, but that's okay because we're only signing a six-month lease, and are well aware that this is just a temporary place.

We're moving to Washington for a variety of reasons, but mostly it's a mix of Annie's family being in the area, and houses being a lot cheaper up there.

So anyways, like I was saying, the good news is that we got approved for the apartment, so we're planning on moving on Halloween, which gives us six weeks to pack and get ready.
