**Red Things: Rust, blood, roses, meat, plums, bruises, negatives of ice; sunsets in smoggy cities, poison-arrow frogs, henna dye, [MISERY.](http://misery.subnet.at/gfx/mim_0024_lookinglasself.jpg)**

Misery is an incredible Photoshop artist, but he's kind of sad... a patron of the Stile Project. His images of women have all this energy, like the burning filament of a light bulb... but their subjects are almost invariably cut, pierced, tattooed, bloodied, painfully integrated with machinery, or all of the above...

I think Misery is one of a wave of techno-arteests who are going to control the look of movies, record covers, and advertising for some time. It's going to creep in around the edges at first, the way the Amiga MOD community and all the other early computer music led to, say, Moby.

They're alienated, intelligent, and their prose sucks. They have everything to show, and nothing to say. And maybe it's because words deal with set meanings, while images are unbounded... There's a [vast amount of information](http://deskmod.org/?page=show&id=9529&design=default) here, but what it tells you is going to be different from what it tells me. If it tells you anything.

This is a new kind of art. I mean, if you wanted to be an art-historian about it, I'm sure you could lump Misery in with fantasy illustrators like [Frazetta](http://www.wadhome.org/frazetta/paintings.html) and [Giger.](http://www.meridian.net.au/Art/Giger/) But you know, both those names sprang to my mind because they were unique enough, and skilled enough, as artists, to make an impact. These guys _created_ genres. Misery and the guys on deskmod and all the other sites are creating a new genre.
