> Here's the difference between Star Trek and the best SF show on TV last year:
>
> **_Star Trek_:**
>
> **Picard:** "Arm photon torpedoes!"
>
> **Riker:** "Captain! Are you sure that's wise?"
>
> **Troi:** "Captain! I'm picking up conflicting feelings about this! And, it appears that you're a 'fraidy cat."
>
> **Wesley:** "Captain, I'm just an annoying punk, but I thought I should say something."
>
> **Worf:** "Captain, can I push the button? This is giving me a big Klingon warrior chubby."
>
> **Giordi:** "Captain, I think we should reverse the polarity on them first."
>
> **Picard:** "I'm so confused. I'm going to go to my stateroom and look pensive."
>
> **_Firefly_:**
>
> **Captain:** "Let's shoot them."
>
> **Crewman:** "Are you sure that's wise?"
>
> **Captain:** "Do you know what the chain of command is? It's the chain I'll BEAT YOU WITH until you realize who's in command."
>
> **Crewman:** "Aye Aye, sir!"
