Ugh. I had a shit day at work today. There's entirely too much stress going on lately, between job stuff, family stuff, and trying to deal with the server - which just reminds me of the whole Steve situation whenever I'm working with it. I'm just going to sign off when work's over and just watch some TV and try to get out of the funk I'm in. My Invader Zim DVD got here today... that might help.
