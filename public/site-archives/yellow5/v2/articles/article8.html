<BIG>Dr. Colossus Sues Former Bandmates</BIG>
<br><SMALL>By Shawn McCallister, freelance music consultant</SMALL>

<p>Amidst a flurry of press coverage and controversy, Harmann Colossus, more popularly known as "Doctor" Colossus, is suing his former band members for possession of the name Yellow Number Five.

<p>Rumors abound as to where the singer has spent the last two years, despite his claims that he was simply living in the Himalayan mountains to "get away from" the music business. Apparently two years was long enough away, and Colossus plans to rejoin the biz using his former band name whether the band likes it or not.

<p>Colossus appears to have a strong case for possession, and legal analysts generally agree that victory is likely for the former lead singer. When asked what his plans for the band are, he announced that he was planning on molding the band into the foremost remix group in the world.

<p>"It's that, or open a chain of hot-dog carts," spoke Colossus.
