I must not have been taking good enough care of myself over the last few days in Portland, because I was starting to get a little sniffly before we left. I just blamed it on allergies, though. However, after the twentieth time that I blew my nose on the train, and the old man two rows in front of me shot me a dirty look again (he did this EVERY SINGLE TIME), I was forced to admit that I may have caught a cold. And sure enough, I woke up the next day with a sore throat. Luckily, on the way to their house, I got Annie's parents to stop at the store and allow me to purchase some cold-fighting-materials. Laden down with Odwalla Vitamin-C-Monster, Orange Juice, Ny-Quil and 7-up, I triumphantly proceeded to engage my disease in chemical warfare. Commence saturation bombing with Vitamin C! Drink lots of 7-up! We'll drown the buggers out! Oh no! The Ny-Quil has caused me to begin a lengthy and nonsensical war analogy!

I spent Thanksgiving day staring blankly into space, and took a nap. I remember eating dinner, but that was pretty much my only lucid moment of the day. The next day I felt much better, so I was able to have some fun with Eric and Jill (and Gavin) when they came to town.

Hopefully the two weeks I have until my DSL line is installed, during which I have to bike or walk to my parents' house every day will not prolong my cold.

Oh, and final note before I'm off to more Ny-Quil induced sleep: Harry Potter was disappointing. Maybe it was because I had just read the books, but it seems to me that if the movie is 2.5 hours long, they could have done a better job. It seriously felt like they just went through the book and pulled out every other page. I think that as a visual accompaniment to the book, it's fantastic... but it doesn't stand on it's own.
