Today I had the privilege of spending an hour at the DMV. Also hanging out at the most happenin' place in town were such local celebrities as:

- 400lb+ mullet man.

- Sleeping hobo with a ticket for number 31 (they were up to 75 when I came in).

- Cute nervous girl.

- Angry prostitute woman.

- Friendly guy with no photo ID, trying to get an Oregon driver's license.

  Yeah, my world is a thrill a minute, I'm telling you. Zach is trying to avoid creepy police-involving dramas at his apartment complex with neurotic people. KT is moving into her awesome new house. Annie's driver's license doesn't expire until 2010. The only funny thing that's happened to me lately is that Steve and I watched the Superbowl at our boss's house (if you know Steve and I at all, you will understand our complete lack of knowledge about football, and will grasp the humor of us at a superbowl party).
