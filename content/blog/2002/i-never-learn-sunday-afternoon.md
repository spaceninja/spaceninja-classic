I Never Learn
**Sunday Afternoon**

NOON: "I think I will upgrade the computers! I've got some more RAM here for mine, and I should switch the hard drives between the two computers so that the one that's plugged into the stereo has the good sound card."

2PM: "Man, moving all these drives around sure is a pain! But I'm sure it will be worth it, and that it won't go catastrophically wrong like every other time I try this kind of thing."

4PM: "There we go! Annie's hard drive in my old case, it working perfectly! Now to fix up my hard drives in her newer case."

6PM: "Was there anything important on my hard drive? Why didn't I make a backup?"

8PM: "Man, this sucks! I've never even SEEN this error screen before! I have no idea what's gone wrong or how to fix it!"

10PM: "AGAAAAAAGH HATE HATE HATE"

MIDNIGHT: My computer is lying in a pile of components and wires, awaiting the magical solution that will solve the horrible new BSOD error I'm getting, and I'm installing Mozilla on Annie's computer so I can still work tomorrow.

10AM: Nothing has changed overnight, no magical solution has presented itself, and I'm getting worried that the best possible result I can get from all this is to just try to put things back the way they were, and if I'm lucky, all I will have to do is reinstall Windows on my computer without having to format (thus losing data that isn't backed up).
