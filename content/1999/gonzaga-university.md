Question: Am I the only person who snickers when they see a "Gonzaga University" sweatshirt? Surely someone else must have seen Encino Man!! Maybe it's just me.

There's something strange about today. The world just seems kind of... off. It's like everything got shifted three inches to the left while I was sleeping, but when I woke up, everything had been moved, so I didn't notice it, other than just a strange feeling. I can't put my finger on it. I just feel strange. It's one of those days where you look outside and it's bright and sunny, but cold and overcast at the same time. We had a lightning storm last night, which is pretty rare here, so it was cool. I got to bed early, so it's not lack of sleep (maybe I got too much?). I woke up and the curtains were open, which was odd. Aaron never opens the curtains in the morning. So it was strange to wake up to a really bright room (our window faces east).

I really can't figure it out. Things are just strange. I bet people are wondering why I'm wandering around campus peering suspiciously at everyone, as if any moment I might find out who did this. But since I don't know what "this" is, all I'm doing is peering suspiciously.

Oh man. This is just going to be one of those days.

Life is busy. There are two weeks left before finals, and I'm hitting the usual choke point, where I'm starting to realize exactly how much work I have to complete in that time. I'm not worried, because this happens every term, and by now I know that this is when I start getting things done, but it is stressful.

I'm looking forward to Spring Break. I'm taking a bunch of people to the beach cabin. My family has a cabin in Twin Rocks, a nice little beach near Tillamook that no one's ever heard of, so it's a great place to go. We'll head up and do the usual. Stay the whole weekend, make a big spaghetti dinner one night, visit the cheese factory, and have a bonfire on the beach. I can't wait to get down there and take a long walk down the shore with Annie. It's funny how little things like that begin to sound infinitely appealing when you don't have access to them.
