I had somewhat of a revelation recently while helping Annie with the computer. Just in the time that she and I have been dating, she's learned a ton about computers. However, while her experience level has risen, her confidence has not risen (as much).

I think that is the essence of the difference between the so-called computer literate and illiterate.

While I would consider myself to be computer literate, and even to possess enough skills to be comfortable working in a computer tech support position, I don't completely understand them. I've never written a program. I don't entirely understand the relationship between the hardware and the software or even the relationship between the stuff on the computer I can see, and the binary code that I know underlies everything. What I have with the computer is not so much knowledge ("literacy") as it is comfort.

I feel comfortable around computers. I believe this comes from having assembled components and installed programs "from scratch." As a result of this, I know that no matter what I do to the computer, I can fix it (by reformatting and starting over). This grants me a certain level of comfort with trying things.

By trying things, I have gained experience. Experience which has given me some knowledge. For example, I recognize the Blue Screen of Death, and I know that the way to treat it most of the time is to simply reboot the computer. But my knowledge ends there. I don't know what the Blue Screen of Death actually signifies, or what would cause it to appear on Annie's computer. I just know from experience that if I reboot the computer, it will probably go away and not bother me anymore.

This is, of course, a simplification. My troubleshooting knowledge does go deeper than that, but it's a good example of my point, which is that most of the knowledge or literacy I have with computers is a direct result of experience gained from having a high level of comfort around computers.

When Annie sees a Blue Screen of Death on her computer, she does not feel comfortable troubleshooting it. Even though in actuality, she knows just about the same amount about what it means as I do. I have more experience, but the real difference between us is that my comfort level with computers is higher.

I've discussed this with some geek friends and they all seem to agree that basically the difference between the computer literate and illiterate comes down to comfort levels.
