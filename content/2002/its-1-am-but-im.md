It's 1 AM. But I'm not going to bed for a few hours because I just came back from the scariest movie ever. holy god. Signs is really really creepy. The only thing I've ever been more scared of was Blair Witch Project (which KT and I saw before everyone knew it was fake, so it was scarier). Now Annie, Sean and I are going to listen to Bill Cosby and watch the Matrix before I can sleep without having nightmares about something I can't tell you about without ruining the movie.
