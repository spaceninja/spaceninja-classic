Things have really calmed down since I last posted. The convention is still packed, and the network is still horrible, but our registration software is working well, and the printers have been less of a problem now that most of the senior volunteers know how to reset them.  
  
I've been taking a bunch of photos, plus I managed to talk the guys who are doing the website into giving me a bunch of videos and photos that they took of the convention so I can show you guys how nuts it is. I'll be posting those as soon as I get home.  
  
Overall, I've really had a good time. I love the GenCon staff, and I've made a lot of friends here. And since they're doing two GenCons every year now, I'll probably be seeing them more frequently than I would have otherwise. Hmm... They're based out of Seattle, maybe sometime when I'm up north I should stop by their office. Heh, I have a list of people as long as my arm that I need to visit when I'm up north, including Daniel, and Urn and Kat.  
  
Anyways, I'm exhausted, but my roommate just went home, so I'll have the hotel room to myself tonight, and should even be able to sleep in a bit tomorrow before we fly home.
