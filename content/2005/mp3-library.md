This weekend, I finally finished ripping all the CDs in our library to MP3 format. This is both for insurance, in case anything happens to the CDs, and for convenience so I can play all my music on my computers. The next project is to get the ID3 tags set up properly so that I can do better genre sorting and neat things in iTunes, and then back everything up to a few DVDs. Here are some interesting statistics:

- 3531 Total songs
- 18.34 Gigabytes of diskspace
- 10.8 Days of playtime
- (10 days, 21 hours, 6 minutes, 54 seconds)
- 25 Genres
- 920 Artists
- 447 Albums

That is probably 98% of all our CDs represented there. There were a few odd CDs that I didn't rip (bagpipe music, bill cosby CDs, etc) and on a few soundtracks I didn't rip all the songs - but on almost every CD I took everything. Now my iPod shuffle should actually have the ability to suprise me by pulling up stuff I'm not expecting.
