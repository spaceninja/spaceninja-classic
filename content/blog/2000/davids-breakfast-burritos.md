- 1 package tortillas
- half to full pound ground sausage
- 6-12 eggs
- milk
- about 8 smallish potatoes
- salsa
- tomatoes (optional, for non-salsa people)
- cheese

1. peel and dice potatoes into small chunks.
2. begin frying potatoes. This will take the longest, so start early.
3. begin frying the sausage in a separate pan.
4. prepare scrambled egg mix (eggs and milk, mixed well) and add to sausage pan.
5. Keep frying until eggs reach appropriate consistency.
6. While all this is going on, heat the tortillas, so they will be flexible, and grate the cheese.
7. combine egg/sausage mix with potatoes in tortilla.
8. add cheese, salsa and/or tomatoes according to taste.
9. Enjoy! Best served with [Cheap Fruit Smoothies](/blog/2000/cheap-fruit-smoothies). Makes between 6-8 burritos.
