so we had a great time traipsing up and down the coast with Steve and Steph (& PI!) yeasterday. I got to poke some really cool dead things with sticks, like crayfish and a jellyfish. there were cute toddlers everywhere, and we got to eat at a cool pub on the beach. On the way home, it was funny because steph had Pi passed out in her lap, and I had miles hiccuping on one side of me, and Scott snoring softly on the other. it was very cute and peacefcul. Plus there were tons of stars out, and the drive was amazing....Thanks Guys!

BTW: you know who else is amazing? SCOTT!!!

heehee!
