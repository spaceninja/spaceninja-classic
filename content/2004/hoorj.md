The company I work for is running the server and registration system for a major convention. That major convention opened for registration the other day, and our server basically collapsed under the load. I've never seen a server get so bogged down without slashdot being involved. Yesterday the entire day was spent trying to find solutions, trying to load balance, trying not to read the hate mail, and just generally developing ulcers in any way possible. It sucks.

In other news, I have finally grown tired of having my mac crash hard about once a week. When I bought the Panther upgrade, I foolishly thought I could actually just upgrade, and my system has been unstable ever since. So right now I'm tarballing all my stuff and backing it up to my PC, and then over my lunch break I'm going to format and reinstall Panther. Hopefully a clean start will give me back the stable solid mac I love so much, and not leave me kicking myself for making a stupid mistake like not backing up my mail archives (already done, just an example).
