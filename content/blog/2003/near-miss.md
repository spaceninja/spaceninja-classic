Yesterday was just a little stressful. I noticed that I was nearly out of space on my main hard drive, so I opened up my "Add/Remove Programs" dialog to see what sort of unneeded programs I could remove. I quickly spotted "Sierra Utilities" in the list. This is an irritating little utility that Sierra force-installs with Half-Life, and won't let you uninstall it while Half-Life is still on your computer. Well, I had uninstalled Half-Life already, so I figured I'd get rid of it, even though it can't have been more than 50 MB.

Anyways, long story short, I had 500 MB free space before I uninstalled it. After the uninstall finished, I had 7.5 GB free.

That right. This 50 MB program deleted seven \_GIGA_bytes of files from my computer.

After some investigation, I discovered that most of my programs were gone, but miraculously, my mozilla profile was spared, which means I hadn't lost all my email since April (my last backup).

So, I'm now running a clean new install of XP, and I've come within a hair's breadth of losing all my data, which has motivated me to start doing weekly backups to my second hard drive, and monthly CD backups.
