<font size=4><b>PEN-NO-PEN!</b></font>
<BR>minutes of fun!

<P>materials needed:

<P>* 1(one) Pen of some type.  Any color will do.
<BR>* Time to burn.  This game is intended as a mildly amusing way to burn up several minutes of time.  Some people don't understand the need to burn time, so to illustrate the point, consider this: This game was created in Sophmore English class.

<P>directions:

<P>1. Hold the pen firmly in right hand, cap facing up  (Note:  Left handed people should reverse the procedure, and hold pen in left hand, cap-up).
<BR>2. With left hand, remove the pen cap and declare loudly "Pen!"
<BR>3. With left hand, replace the pen cap, look sad and announce "no pen."
<BR>4. With left hand, remove the pen cap, look overjoyed, and exclaim "Pen!"
<BR>5. With left hand, replace the pen cap, and look frustrated.  Look around the pen as if it might be hiding behind the pen cap, and pronounce "no pen."
<BR>6. Repeat above procedures until either amused or suicidal.
