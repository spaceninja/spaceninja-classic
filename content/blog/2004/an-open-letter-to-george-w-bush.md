**Stop smirking, for the love of god!**

Do you have any idea how hard it is to take you seriously as you say that you will "honor your commitments" when you're grinning the whole time? That weasly good-old-boy smirk may play well in the South, but up here it just convinces me that you don't mean a word you're saying. This is much worse than the scowling during the first debate.
