new images of the halo 2 figures are up. check them out [here...](http://www.figures.com/databases/action.cgi?setup_file=fignews2.setup&category=actionfigures&topic=158&show_article=35)

the brute looks well sculpted but poorly/barely articulated. which is a step up frm the elite which was barely articulated and badly sculpted.

the master chief upgrade, on the other hand, looks great! which is a shock, since joyride has yet to make anything that was actually as good as it should be. looks like mc2 is actually fully posable, as in, more posable than a nutcracker. unlike the first one.
