not sure about the weather over on the other side of the hills, but over here we just had a very cool weather moment. it was hailing.. and the hail started to come down in big gumball-sized chunks, so i took pi out to play. it stopped momentarily, and the hail turned to snow!! in the middle of may! awesome!
