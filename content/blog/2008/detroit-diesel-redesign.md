[![Detroit Diesel 2008 Redesign](/images/2863067365_384da9e619.jpg)](http://www.detroitdiesel.com/)

About a month ago, we launched the new [Detroit Diesel](http://www.detroitdiesel.com/) redesign. We were working on this site when I was first hired at Pop Art, and while I'm proud of the code we wrote the first time, our standards have evolved a bit over time. The opportunity to revisit the site and kick it up a notch was very exciting.

The design team and I worked closely on a bottom-up approach, where we put a lot of effort into the templates and underlying grid structure for all pages. By focusing on these aspects of the site first, rather than designing the landing pages and then interpreting those designs for all the other pages, I think we got a more coherent look to the site. Plus, the grid that was built into the pages made it extremely simple to float photos and charts into pages without having to write complicated page-specific CSS.

In addition, our copywriters rewrote all the content on the site to better match the brand's tone of voice. Combined with the new black-and-chrome color scheme and prevalent use of large images, and I think the new site really packs a punch.

**Note:** This was originally posted on [my work blog](http://blogs.popart.com/scott-vandehey/), and I'm re-posting it here for archival purposes.
