My 360 is on the way home to me! I got the box to ship it to Microsoft on the 16th, and they received it on the 18th, and then today I got this email:

> Dear Scott Vandehey,
>
> Xbox Customer Support Service Request ID #: XXX Serial Number: XXX
>
> Good news, your Xbox console has been shipped! You can expect to receive it in 3-5 business days.
>
> For your convenience, your shipping information is provided below:
>
> Carrier Name : UPS Carrier Tracking Number : XXX
>
> You may track the status of your package using the UPS website and the tracking number provided above.

> If you have questions, please go to www.xbox.com for the most up to date information.
>
> Thank you for your business.
>
> Note: Please do not reply to this message, as it is not a monitored e-mail address.

I was worried that this was going to take a long time, but this is actually a pretty respectable turnaround. With luck, I'll have my 360 back up and running within a week!
