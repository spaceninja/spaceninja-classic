ha

A singular _ha_ is the smallest amount of jocularity that retains the properties of laughter. It is the atomic level of laughing. Used infrequently to indicating grudging laughter, such as from an unfunny joke delivered by one's employer, or when the typist is upset but forced to concede the source material is funny.

heh

Like the atomic _ha_, _heh_ indicates the lowest levels of amusement, but unlike the frequently reluctant _ha_, _heh_ indicates honest enjoyment, albeit a small amount.

haha

The most common form used, _haha_ communicates that something is genuinely funny. It can be assumed that this is a quiet, inward enjoyment. If you could see the typist, they would likely be smiling, but not laughing out loud.

hehe

Similar to _haha_, _hehe_ is used to indicate general amusement, though perhaps declining. Useful when a friend has been saying funny things for awhile, but the typist is losing interest and needs to get back to work. _\[ref. Figure 1\]_

Figure 1: Use of _hehe_ to politely end engagement

heehee

Infrequently used by men, since it seems feminine. Primarily used in reaction to titillating source material or imitating schoolgirls.

hahaha

Used when a joke is unreservedly funny, often as an escalation from an earlier use of _haha_ to indicate a greater level of enjoyment.

hahahaha

Anything over four '_ha_'s is equivalent, and represents uncontrolled laughter, frequently audible.

lol

Although it technically stands for "laughing out loud," use of _lol_ frequently indicates the opposite. Due to early overuse on the internet, _lol_ is now often used ironically, or as a general shorthand for mocking laughter.

LOLOLOL

Used exclusively for laughing at memes.
