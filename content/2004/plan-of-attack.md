Sorry for the lengthy delay in posting, there's been a lot of stuff going on lately. Here's my to-do list for non-work items:

1. Try to reinstall FreeBSD on the server, to confirm once and for all if the server will return.
2. Make a big photo post here on Rusted, with photos of the party, our beach trip, and of Leilani and her new swingset.
3. Restore websites (either on repaired server, or on new hosting), put up KMorg archives somewhere that people can download their journal contents.
4. Set up [NewsBeat.org](http://www.newsbeat.org/) with Jill.
5. New designs for Rusted - I actually made some progress on this on the train ride Saturday.
