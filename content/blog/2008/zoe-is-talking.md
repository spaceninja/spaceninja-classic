Her vocabulary is very limited, but she's really interested. She listens carefully to new words and then tries to repeat them. Right now, she can (sort of) say Baby (bah-bah), Kitty (keh-t), Socks (sah-zz), Mama, Papa (bah-bah), Yes (yesh), and probably some others that I'm forgetting. In this video, I turned the viewfinder around so she could see herself while I was filming, so she's pointing and saying "baby" over and over. I'm not sure if she knows it's her - what age are they supposed to start recognizing themselves?
