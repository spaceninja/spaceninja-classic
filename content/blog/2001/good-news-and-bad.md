Hmmm... I'm not sure how to feel lately. I've had one great thing happen and one potentially horrible thing happen.

Bad News First: I came into work the other day and my bosses asked me to talk to them. They told me that money was tight, and business was slow, and would I mind going home each day as soon as I finish my work, instead of staying the whole 8 hour shift. Now, I understand where they're coming from, and I'd almost rather go home than have them find more grunt work for me to do, but this is very bad timing. Basically, they're kicking me back down to 20 hours a week, and Annie's still unemployed. This means we can't pay bills. So basically, we're back to square one, poverty-level income, no spending money, stress about jobs, and not knowing whether we'll still be living in Ellensburg in two months. Thanks to the money from the Myst3 job, I've got this month's bills payed guaranteed, and also I managed to find out I can get a forbearance on my loans. But next month is up in the air. Annie's taking it more seriously and applying at a few more jobs, but next week she'll have to apply at Jack In The Box if no one's already hired her. If things get really bad, I might have to think about getting a second job, but I want to make sure I'm available for those days when there is enough work for me to stay all day. The worst thing about this situation is not knowing what's going to happen. We've got to live minute to minute, with very little possibility to plan ahead, which is extremely frustrating for me.

The Good News I fixed my computer! Ever since I bought it, the sound on my system hasn't worked. The motherboard has a built-in sound card, and I even bought another sound card just in case. But nothing I did helped, and the Asus, the company that built the motherboard, wouldn't answer any questions. After this long, I had just about given up, and was getting ready to buy a new motherboard when I found another post on the tech support forums. Turns out another guy with the same motherboard and case that I have found out that one of the mounting screws that attaches the motherboard to the case was touching the circuits and causing a short. It's not a needed mounting screw, so I removed it and my sound IMMEDIATELY started working. It's such a stupid problem that I'm amazed I didn't figure it out, but I'm so happy to have my computer completely functioning that I moved on and started installing games and stuff.
