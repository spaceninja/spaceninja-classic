My 360 died again. Just six months after Microsoft sent me a replacement for the one that died, the replacement itself has died.

My screen was freezing after playing a game for a few minutes. Suddenly the whole game would just stop, no error message, no lights, no response to the controllers, nothing. I looked the issue up on the support site, tried the suggestions (basically all the common sense stuff like checking the cables and trying different games, and also clearing the hard drive cache), but nothing fixed it.

Finally, I called tech support, who had me try a couple more things, and then while I was on the phone with them, I got the red ring of death. They're sending me a box to ship them my console, as well as the power cable (which they didn't take last time).

One funny thing is that this time around, Annie's almost as upset as I am - playing [Carcassonne](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/c/carcassonnexboxlivearcade/) has become part of her daily routine during Zoe's naps!
