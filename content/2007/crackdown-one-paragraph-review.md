Crackdown is a great game with one major feature lacking: local co-op. When I bought the game, I was really excited because it was clearly labeled as a two-player game. Turns out what they mean is it's two-player over xbox live. So since no one else I know owns the game, and I'm not into gaming with strangers, the co-op mode doesn't exist. Lucky for me, the game is surprisingly fun. Yes, it's a GTA knockoff, but it's done quite well. All the driving is just as much fun as in GTA, but the really cool bit is jumping from rooftop to rooftop like a superhero, and beefing up your strength until you can throw cars at people. Plus, it included an invite to the Halo 3 beta next month.
