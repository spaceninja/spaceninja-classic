Behold, the archive MASTER.

I've spent the last couple days learning about how the archives work in MT, and I've been suitably impressed. Archiving is powerful and flexible in MT, especially coming from F5K, which had no archiving whatsover, just previous and next links. Until a few days ago, I never thought I'd need more than that.

However, with a blog that has been online for 3Â½ years and has over 1,000 entries, previous and next links make it a bit tricky to get to older posts. The search engine helps quite a bit, but the archives allow me to finally give a logical structure to find posts in, and also different ways to look them up.

- [Archives Index](/archives/)
- [Categories List](/archives/categories.php)
- [Yearly Archive](/archives/2004/)
- [Monthly Archive](/archives/2004/02/)
- [Individual Archive (permalink)](/archives/2004/02/001185.php)

And as well as being logically archived, MT saves a file for each archive, meaning that the permalinks for the posts are actually tied to files, meaning that they can truly be archived, and spidered through search engines, which was never possible with F5K.

(footnote: I debated for awhile about the naming scheme for the permalinks. By default, the entry ID is padded to six numbers, eg: 001185.php. I was worried that maybe six wasn't enough and that someday I'd have to up it to seven or eight... but then I did some math and found out that it will take me 20 or 30 years to exceed six numbers, and by then I'll probably have to do more than just change the numbering scheme, so six will do for now.)

Now that I'm happy with the back end, and have my archives all structured the way I want, I can focus on cleaning up the HTML code a bit, and work on some design issues. I'm getting pretty tired of the blue and gray color scheme.

**Edit 10/26/2005:** Ironically, I'm making this edit nearly two years later, as I again reorganize my archives. These early attempts were instrumental, but ultimately unsucessful in their attempts to make the archives easier to use. Needless to say, the above links no longer work. Instead, you can find the archives at [spaceninja.com/blog-archives/](/blog-archives/).
