I woke up this morning 15 minutes before my alarm went off (of course), but it turned out to be a good thing, because Zoe also woke up, and I got to feel her kicking pretty much non-stop until I had to go take my shower. I was stoked because Zoe rarely kicks for me. Annie, I'm sure, was less pleased at the constant activity in her belly while she tried to sleep.
