So, I killed the automatic Del.icio.us link posting. Long story short, it was going to be a big pain in the butt to get it working again, and I was questioning whether I wanted it back at all. Originally, I set it up because I was distrustful of Del.icio.us as a long-term archiving scheme, and I didn't want to lose all my links if they ever went away. However, in the intervening years, they got bought by Yahoo, and I also started using other third-party services, none of which are archived here on the blog, so my original motivation for using the archiving script was gone.

I know several of you said that you liked the feature, and I apologize. However, there are still several ways to get at my links if you're interested.

1. The most recent links will still show up in the sidebar on every page.
2. You can view them directly on Del.icio.us by clicking on [Links](http://delicious.com/spaceninja/) up in the header.
3. If you're using a feedreader, you can subscribe to a new feed I created that merges my blog posts with my Del.icio.us links. I've added a link to the new [Full Entries plus Links](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/spaceninjalinks) feed in the Subscribe box in the sidebar.
