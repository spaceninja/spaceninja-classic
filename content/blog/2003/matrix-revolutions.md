As you may or may not know, the theatrical trailer for Matrix Revolutions has been posted on \[http://thematrix.com/\].

I just watched it, and for those of you who are like Miles or my brother Sean, and are concerned that you will figure out the entire movie from the trailer: You're probably right. Avoid it at all costs. The TV spots are similar, but don't give away nearly as much.

However, for those of you who are like me, and know that you'll enjoy the movie and still be suprised by the plot even after viewing the trailer: It's awesome. Check it out.
