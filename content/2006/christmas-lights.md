Here's a shot I snapped of the big Christmas Tree in Pioneer Square in downtown Portland. They ship this giant thing in on a flatbed truck, and then a crew of guys in cherry-pickers frankenstein it back together over the next few days. As you can see, when they get it done, it looks pretty sweet.

I posted this and a few other to a [Christmas Lights 2006 photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/sets/72157594421090344/) on flickr, which I plan to add to over the next week, especially when we go through [Peacock lane](http://peacocklane.net/), where they typically put on a good display. You might also like this photo of the lights at our house.

We've got cats who eat power cords, so I couldn't put lights inside the windows, and I'm too lazy/incompetent to properly string lights outside. Because of this, I was pretty happy with myself when I figured out that I could string a red and green light bulb in the attic windows to get a nice effect.
