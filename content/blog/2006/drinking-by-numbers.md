Awhile ago, a site called [Cooking By Numbers](http://cookingbynumbers.com/) made the rounds. Basically, you tell it what you have in your kitchen, and it tells you what you can make for dinner. It's a cool idea, and it was only a matter of time before someone thought to do the same thing for the liquor cabinet. [Extra Tasty!](http://www.extratasty.com/) lets you enter in all the various bottles of booze, mixers, and garnishes you have in the house, and it will return drink recipes you can make. It's well-executed, and uses all sorts of modern AJAX-y goodness. The only downfall is that all the recipies are user-contributed. The only quality control comes in the form of grades on each drink recipe, which are obviously a bit subjective, and vulnerable to gaming. Still, once the site has been up for awhile and has a larger pool of recipes to pull from, it should be pretty cool - and it could be a lot of fun at a party, though maybe setting a computer up near the bar isn't the best idea.
