<br>Once again, LCT has restructured! To see the new breakdown of duties, check out the <a href="cnslct.php">lct</a> page. We've hired two new Teks, Zan Gilgorov and Cristina Crespo. Congratulations on completing your training, guys! Now that we (finally) have a full compliment of Teks, positions have been reorganized a bit so that those who are leaving this summer can help train the newbies. Mark, Miles and Scott have all been appointed area "leads," where they will assist the Teks assigned to their areas learn the ropes.

<br>Shem Giles Arrested! In an unprecedented act for the FBI, the now infamous supervisor of the Tek Team was held responsible for the actions of his team and taken into police custody. Following an FBI sting operation, several hundred gigabytes worth of pirated MIDI music files were found on the team computers. "Yeah, it all started with a MIDI of the Mortal Kombat song... and then we were all hooked. We would spend hours at night downloading these bootleg tunes," quoted Scott Vandehey, a member of the team. "The thing I can't figure out is why they arrested Shem," said Jerod Alexander, another team member. "I mean, he doesn't even like techno music. I think he mostly listens to Polka CDs."

Jerod Alexander takes over the new Stott Center labs and the Celeron machines in NH96, as well as the three ESL machines there.

<br>LCT's website has a new look! The new design debuted today to mixed reactions among the LCT staff. "I think it looks fantastic!" exclaimed designer Scott Vandehey. "What's with all the green? Couldn't it be purple like the PSU page?" questioned Miles Johnson. "Why can't I be Darth Vader?" cried Brandon Wooters.
