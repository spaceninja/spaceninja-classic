A few weeks back, you may have seen that the [Halo 3 Achievements](http://www.xbox360achievements.org/achievements.php?gameID=274) were leaked. If you're like me, you gave that list a quick look, and saw that it was a nice mix of single and multiplayer challenges, and didn't think much more about it. However, I just noticed something that made me very excited:

> **40G - Marathon Man:** Locate and access all Terminals in the Campaign.

Yeah, that's an achievement rewarding the player for reading all the computer terminals in the game, just like Halo's spiritual predecessor, Marathon. This little homage is cool, but it also means that Halo 3 will still have a heavy story behind it, which is fantastic.

If I totaled up all the time I had spent reading the [Marathon's Story](http://marathon.bungie.org/story/) site and the [Halo Story](http://halosm.bungie.org/story/) site, it would be kind of ridiculous. But it speaks to the quality of the back story for those games, and it makes me very excited for Halo 3.
