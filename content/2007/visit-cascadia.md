[![Visit Cascadia](/images/481998127_d65a5360d5.jpg)](http://www.visitcascadia.com/)

The guys I work with at Pop Art just launched a site they've been working on for quite awhile now, and I'm really excited to finally be able to talk about it. The site is [VisitCascadia.com](http://www.visitcascadia.com/), and it's a promotional site for the new Freightliner truck, the [Cascadia](http://www.drivecascadia.com/), framed as a site for a city populated entirely by truckers. It's really funny, and full of tiny little details everywhere you look. Be sure to check out the extra-tall garages on the [town map](http://visitcascadia.com/visitorsguide/explore.aspx), the movie showing at [the drive-in](http://visitcascadia.com/visitorsguide/drivein.aspx), and the [Request-O-Matic](http://visitcascadia.com/request-o-matic/default.aspx), in which a concerned citizen will email your boss recommending that he buy you a Cascadia.
