ALCOHOL + POKEY = TOP SECRET PROJECT

COMING SOON

I invited KT, Steve, Miles, Zach and Sean over for dinner and dessert and party, and we had a blast. Dinner turned out well, Dessert turned out better, and eventually things got creative and we started working on a top secret project, which we will finish next week and post.

In the meantime, check out this fancy video clip that Steve took. It's a wonderful insight into the fojar-approved creative process (Scott: sweet! How'd you do that? Miles: By accident, like I do most things.) as well as a quick video tour of my house, and a wonderful monster-movie shot of Zach. It's 6 Megs, but if you've got a good connection, I think it's worth loading.

On my PC, at least, if I just click on that link, it trys to play it in my browser, which would take forever with a 6MB movie... Try right-clicking and selecting "save target as..."
