Remember [Gary Dirin](/tags/gary-dirin/)? There are certainly plenty of stories to remember, but without a doubt the best of them is the _Pulp Cereal_ story that Sean was writing. It's unfinished, but I still feel its some of the best work he's ever done, and while it's reminiscent of Tolkien or even Lovecraft at times, the subject is fiercely original. Refresh your memory here in the [Space Ninja archives](/blog-archives/).
