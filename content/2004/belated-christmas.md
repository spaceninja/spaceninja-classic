Due to car problems, Annie and I weren't able to do Christmas day with my family as planned. But my family was really nice and waited for us, and last night we had a belated Christmas. And the suprise bonus for all of us was that for the first time in at least 15 years, we had a white christmas!

It was great, we had a big spaghetti dinner, and then opened presents in the living room, and then watched some of the new DVDs people got as presents.

Then, Annie and I came home and finished writing all of our wedding thank-you notes while watching a _Clean-Sweep_ marathon on TLC.

Next challenge: mailing the thank-you notes!
