<div class="entry">Huh. That's weird. I made a post here yesterday about GenCon and how much fun I was having, and it seems to have spontaniously deleted itself. Fun.<br />
<br />
Oh well, the important thing is this:<br />
<br />
<b>I kicked Boba Fett's ass.</b><br />
<br />
Daniel Logan, the kid who played young Boba Fett in the Star Wars movies was here signing autographs, and he came over and played Halo with us for a few hours in the game LAN. He was a lot of fun to play with, and he traded Yahoo accounts with us all so we could meet up to play online together.</div>

<div class="entry">Yeah, so I've been talking like Frankenstein's monster a lot... party GOOD! cold BAD!<br />
<br />
We had an amazing party over the weekend! At the wedding and related festivities, there was mingling between our Portland friends and our Washington friends, and in particular, KT and the Washington girls.<br />
<br />
So KT decided that we should throw a party here in Portland and get all of them to come down. This we did. We planned ahead, and decided to have a Veteran's Day party (but then had to delay it a week), and we bought prodigious amounts of alcohol, and lots of sandwich makings for food, and made up a fancy invitation.<br />
<br />
And everyone came! Urn and Kat, Dave and Rose, Zach and Noah, Daniel and Becky, and almost all of our Portland friends, except for Eric and Jill and Sean, who were sick. The party went late, and we played games, and watched goofy film clips, and played drinking games. Daniel brought his magic camera, which takes photos of normal situations and inserts drunk girls grabbing each other's boobs into them (for reference, see the wedding photos he took).<br />
<br />
Eventually people started passing out around 3:30am. Then we got up and 8am, and kept partying! It was a lot of fun, and I'm really glad everyone came down. Hopefully, we'll be able to do it again, before too long!<br />
<br />
The only bad thing is that the lack of sleep and the alcohol seem to have combined to lower my resistance to the cold that's going around, and I can feel the effects starting even now. I'm trying to stay warm and drink lots of water, but it might already be too late.<br />

<br />
<small>Photos and stuff coming soon!</small><br />
<br />
PS: Other Stuff!<br />
It's been long enough since I posted that I've forgotten to mention the other stuff that's been happening, such as the satellite debacle (it's a long and boring story, with the end result that we're now getting cable instead). I also got to go to Seattle for a work-related conference, which was fun, but completely uninterested to anyone who doesn't work at my job, and now I remember why I didn't post any of this stuff.</div>

<div class="entry">So, here are my conclusions:<br />
<br />
Matrix:Reloaded: <b>Good</b><br />
<br />
Reloaded on IMAX: <b>Awesome!</b><br />
<br />
I was amazed. I heard so much bad press about it, and I actually really liked it. I have absolutely no complaints about this one. It's better than the first one, and better than the second one by far.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm sure there are those who will disagree with me, but if you happen to share my taste in movies, then you will likely enjoy it.<br />
<br />

And if, by any chance, you're in Seattle, go see it on IMAX right away!</div>

<div class="entry">The landlord came by yesterday, checked out the house, and approved a side mounting, and splicing into the existing cable wire for the satellite, which (I think) means that I only get one receiver, since we won't want to run a cable down the length of the house to the other TV.<br />
<br />
Still, Hooray!</div>

<div class="entryheader"><a name="4044"></a><span class="username">scott</span>  <br><span class="title">Landlord Woes</span> <span class="date">(2003-11-10 09:58:29)</span></a>  <span class="link">[<a href="#">link</a>]</span> <span class="link">[<a href="#">send</a>]</span>    </div>

<div class="entry">So, the satellite installation guy showed up this morning at 9am, only to find out that we didn't have written permission from our landlord yet, who is hemming and hawing over whether or not to allow this.<br />
<br />
<b>Landlord:</b> So why do you want this instead of cable?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Well, it's cheaper, installation is free, and it comes with a free TiVO-like system.<br />
<b>Landlord:</b> How much cheaper?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Installation is free, and it costs $5 less per month.<br />

<b>Landlord:</b> It's only $5 cheaper?<br />
<b>Me:</b> Well, yes, plus no installation fees, and the TiVO system.<br />
<b>Landlord:</b> Hmm.<br />
<br />
So the landlord had to talk to the installer to see what the options were, which the installer explained (very patiently), at the end of which, the landlord decided that he couldn't decide now, and could we reschedule?<br />
<br />
So now my satellite might be installed on Saturday morning, and the landlord is going to swing by the house tomorrow to check out the possible mounting spots.<br />

<br />
Appearently, rather than use the existing cable hole which comes in right behind the TV, he wants to mount over the attic and drill through there, or something.<br />
<br />
Ugh. I have got to get a house. I'm so tired of having to deal with the landlord every time we want to do anything.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before anyone chimes in to defend the landlord by saying "Well, it is his property, and he can make decisions he wants", You're absolutely right, and I understand that. But that doesn't make it any less frustrating when he won't put gutters on the house, or let us get a cat (without paying more rent), or any of the other problems we've had with him.<br />
<br />
I've said it before: When your landlord is a person who wants to be your friend, it's a bad situation. You're better off with a faceless corporation, oddly enough, because at least they enact common-sense rules and stick to them, rather than make decisions on the spot, change their minds later, and deny they ever changed their minds.</div>
