We might be moving back to Portland this summer, instead of next summer, as we had originally planned. The situation here is a lot rougher than either of us had thought it would be. The job market is terrible. Annie's still unemployed, and my boss has cut my hours back so much that we're barely able to cover bills. After my money from the Myst3 job runs out, we _won't_ be able to cover them unless Annie finds a source of income. So that's one reason. In addition, Annie is "not excited" about school next year. She says that it might make sense to move back to Portland, because then she could do Americorps for another year, and then finish up school down there, at PSU. And on top of all that, we can't deny that one of the reason is that nearly all of our friends are moving this summer. Urn and Kat will be leaving, and so will Eric and Jill. Becky and Jessi will still be here, but we barely see them anyway.

We talked about it for a long time last night, and it's sounding better each time we talk. The only problem is that unless the money situation improves a lot, and quickly, enabling us to get some money saved, when we move back, we won't actually have enough money to move into an apartment right away. We'll probably have to move into my parent's house for a little bit while we both find jobs and get enough money cached to pay first month's rent, plus security and cleaning deposit.

We still need to check a few things out, like if moving early breaks our lease, or if we can just take off in the summer, and whether Annie can get another job in Americorps. Still, the job market in Portland is so much better than here, that even if we both had to take crummy mall jobs or something, we'd be okay. Plus, Portland means that I could try to get a graphic design job, or even get involved in web design!

It's all still up in the air, and basically it's Annie's decision, but we're checking out our options.

In addition to all that, I finally realized that my cousin Deni married the lead singer of [the Ataris](http://www.ataris.com/), a band that I like. When my family told me that Deni had married a rock star, I kinda rolled my eyes, and even when I met him, I didn't place the name of the band. But Annie and I were on the radio and played two songs by his band that I know, and love! So suddenly it all fell into place! Cool!

Jester called me and told me he has no idea why my second check from the [Myst3](http://www.myst3.com/) job hasn't gotten to me, and that he also has no idea why the themes aren't up on the site yet. Apparently both should have been done quite a while ago. As soon as I know what's up, I'll post about it.
