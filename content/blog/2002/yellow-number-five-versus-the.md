[Yellow Number Five versus The Blues Brothers - Rawhide](http://spaceninja.local/site-archives/yellow5/v2/media/y5-rawhide.mp3)

That link will let you download the project Zach and I were working on today. It's a techo remix of the theme from Rawhide, as sung by the Blues Brothers.

It's still a rough draft, but I'm pretty happy with the direction it's headed. The final version will have a catchier sample at the start of the song, will be two to three times a long, and will have sections of the chorus and one of the verses sampled.

And if you like that, then check out the other two files [in the directory](http://zip.fojar.com:8080/mp3/y5/), which are Zach's rough drafts of a couple techno remixes of Johnny Cash.

We'd love to hear what you think!

**Edit 10/26/2005:** We no longer control the fojar domain name, and the extra files of Zach's have been lost.
