Last night, Annie and I joined Eric, Zima and Zach over at Daniel's house to carve pumpkins and eat [P.E.O.](http://www.peointernational.org/aboutPEO.html) Bean Soup, which is awesome. After the soup and the intake of a few beers, it was decided that on the three pumpkins, one would be a cat's face (Zima's, of course), one would be a twichy looking guy, who Zach called the Happy Noodle Boy, and one that was Invader Zim yelling. After about an hour, we were all pleased to discover that ours were the most beautiful jack-o-lanterns in the entire history of pumpkin carving. And the wide array of cutting impliments we made use of was pretty impressive, too. It spanned the gamut from an x-acto knife to a melon baller.
