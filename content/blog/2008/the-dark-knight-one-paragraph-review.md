Wow. I expected this to be like most sequels: good, but not quite living up to the original. I was completely blown away. It's pretty long (two and a half hours) but it actually uses that time well, and the story is great — dealing with the logical consequences of Batman's actions. My favorite thing is that there's no back story for the Joker. He doesn't need one, because he's a force of nature. He's an agent of chaos that the other characters react against. Heath Ledger dominates the movie. His take on the Joker is completely convincing, and as [Graeme](http://io9.com/5026466/the-dark-knight-twice-as-long-as-it-should-be) points out, "For the first time outside of the comics — and perhaps just the first time anywhere — the Joker actually is scary and disturbing."
