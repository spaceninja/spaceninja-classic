Yesterday sucked. It was really stressful to begin with, as Annie and I both had a lot to get done, and finding a mouse didn't help, as we then had to put everything aside for awhile as we cleaned and reorganized to make the house less mouse-friendly.

In the evening came the bright spot in the day, which was our home-buying class at PCC. That was excellent. The guys really treated it as a complete introduction, and covered a little of everything. It's a very large topic, obviously, but both Annie and I walked out feeling a great deal more informed and confident about the whole process. We're probably going to call a loan officer over spring break (after getting our credit checked out) to find out how much we can pre-quality for, so we have an idea of what range to shop in.

Then comes the fun part, of actually getting to go house-hunting during the summer!

On the way home, we stopped at Freddy's to buy some mouse traps, and then went to my parents' house to drop off some photo albums of theirs, and pick up some boxes of my stuff that Sean found in the basement.

I started looking through them today, and it's alternately nostalgic and horrifically embarrassing. The boxes mostly consist of old school papers and stacks and stacks of art projects from dozens of art classes taken at every stage of my education. I'm extremely excited to get my high school photography back, and some of the illustration work I did in college, but the reams and reams of old comic books I drew in middle school and high school make me cringe.

Maybe I'll scan a few and post them here as a way to confront old demons.
