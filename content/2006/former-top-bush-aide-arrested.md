One of President Bush's former top aides was [arrested recently](http://today.reuters.com/News/newsArticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&storyID=2006-03-11T172751Z_01_N11336051_RTRUKOC_0_US-BUSH-AIDE.xml). For those of you keeping count, that means that:

- Someone in the vice-president's office leaked the identity of a CIA agent to the public.
- The vice-president shot a man in the face while in office.
- The head of FEMA resigned after bumbling the handling of a natural disaster.
- A former top domestic policy advisor was arrested on felony theft charges.
- A recent Gallup poll shows Bush has the highest disapproval rating of any president since Nixon with 44%, and his approval rating of 36% places him just above Carter and Nixon.
- Oh, and the president took us to war based on faulty intelligence.

That the Democrats couldn't find someone to beat these clowns in the last election just depresses me even more.
