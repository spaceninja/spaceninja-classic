So Urn and I officially have a radio show! It's called Off-Topic, and it's a weekly talk show. It's going to start Winter term, and it will be on Monday nights from 10pm to Midnight. Yes, it is kind of an odd time-slot for a talk show, but seeing as how we didn't have any options, we figured we'd roll with it. On the plus side, as Jeff pointed out, everyone is in town on a Monday night, so our potential listening audience is pretty high.
