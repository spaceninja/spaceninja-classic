[![The Office Filled With Balloons](/images/470547464_9fd63f3fc7.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceninja/470547464/)

On Friday, our CEO was out of the office for his birthday. So we filled his office with 300 balloons. We got the helium tank from a place downtown, and it took about a half-hour for a bunch of us to inflate all 300. We found out that 300 balloons is the perfect amount to cover the entire ceiling of the office with a single layer of balloons. It looked pretty awesome.
