Welcome to KMorg (that's our horrible abbreviation of KillingMachines.org, for those of you who don't understand).

What _is_ KMorg, anyways? One answer would be that it's a weblog of sorts. What's a weblog?

"Weblogs are regularly updated Web sites featuring links to other sites, usually with commentary for each link" (as defined by [FTrain](http://www.ftrain.com/index.php3?id=51&xection_id=1&show=8)).

Weblog examples: [rat bastard](http://www.ratbastard.org) and [apathy](http://electrobacon.com/apathy/).

However, this is not just a site collecting links to other sites, though you'll probably see plenty of that. This site is where the three of us who run this site (myself, Steve, and Miles) will post whatever we feel like.

Some days it will be entertaining, some days it probably won't.

Wait, what am I saying? It will _always_ be entertaining! How could you not be entertained by three charming fellows such as ourselves?
