I have mixed feelings about the beta. On the one hand, it's totally good. The gameplay is exactly what you would expect - sort of a synthesis of the best parts of Halo and Halo 2. The feeling is familiar, all the new weapons and gadgets really enhance the experience, and the graphics are beautiful. On the other hand, I really don't like playing Halo online with strangers, so it's a bit frustrating to get a taste of the game now, but not be able to spend any time doing what I really like Halo for - co-op campaign mode and local multiplayer. Adding to my frustration is that it takes an incredibly long time to get into a match, because you have to wait through loading Crackdown, then loading Halo, and then for it to find a match. Still, it's nice to get a taste of what the final game will be like, and now I'm even more excited for the single-player campaign.
