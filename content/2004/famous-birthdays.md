While looking up [Dead Celebrities](http://dpsinfo.com/dps/),\* it occurred to me to seek out [celebrities who shared our birthdays](http://www.famousbirthdays.com). Here's what we found out: Molli has the same birthday as Mr. T, Fairuza Balk, and Fats Waller.

Sean and I have the same birthday as The Red Baron (Baron von Richthofen), Dr. (Benjamin) Spock, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. And our cousin Dan.

Leilani shares her birthday not only with Flag Day, but Harriet Beecher Stowe, Boy George, and Donald Trump.

Scott has the same birthday as Alanis Morisette, Morgan Freeman, Marilyn Monroe, and Rene "Odo" Auberjonois.

Annie can go partying with Tori Amos, Ray Bradbury, John Lee Hooker, and the late Dorothy Parker.

My dad was born on the same day as Upton Sinclair, Sophia Loren, and Jelly Roll Morton.

My mom was born on the same day as A.A. Milne, Mark Messier, Kevin "Dances with Wolves" Costner, Danny Kaye, Cary Grant, Oliver Hardy, and Daniel Webster (but not the Devil).

Quite a round-up.

> > \* For those who wanted to know why were looking up dead celebrities in the first place, rest assured that Peter, Paul _and_ Mary are all still alive, although apparently the Yellow Power Ranger is dead.
