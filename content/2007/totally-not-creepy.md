> "I used to think that it wouldn’t be fun to dress a boy, but I’ve realized that it is actually MORE fun than dressing a girl because I can dress him in the clothes I would want Michael to wear. He is like my own little boyfriend, in a totally non-creepy way." \-- Marci, discussing [buying clothes for her son](http://partialmarshall.com/?p=56)
