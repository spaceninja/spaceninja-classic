I feel like I haven't posted in forever. I got back from Indy on Monday, took Tuesday off from work, slowly started catching up on Wednesday, only realize Wednesday night that I was coming down with a cold. It got bad enough that I called in sick for Thursday, and I have virtually no memory of the next two days, which are a haze of discomfort and sleeplessness. When I "came to" yesterday, I felt a little better, but I still have a lingering cough and my whole body aches.  
  
Plus, when I'm sick I never sleep well, so last night I was having stress-induced nightmares about failing out of school, and the registration system for school was an amagamation of all the worst features from the one we built for GenCon.  
  
I feel a little better today, and I've put on some music in the hopes of stirring myself back to life and maybe getting some stuff done today.  
  
The one good piece of news from the last week is that my boss sent me a hefty bonus with my paycheck.
