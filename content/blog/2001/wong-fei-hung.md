Oh man, we just got back from seeing the re-release of _Once Upon A Time In China_, a film that helped Jet Li hit the big time. I recognized the name of his character in the movie, and Miles helped me remember where I had seen it. Wong Fei Hung is the main character of both this film and the Drunken Master series! Then Miles told me that Wong is sort of a folk legend hero in China. I looked it up online, and found out that Wong Fei Hung is sort of a Chinese Robin Hood. Stories abound about him helping the poor and downtrodden and there are fantastic stories about his martial arts abilities, like the time he defeated a 30-man gang on the docks of Canton. Check [these](http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Ginza/5990/wong.html) [links](http://www.kungfucinema.com/a_wongfeihung.htm) out for more information, or do your own [search](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=Wong+Fei+Hung).
