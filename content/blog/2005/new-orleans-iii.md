If you haven't seen it already, be sure to check out this [photo slideshow](http://www.kodakgallery.com/Slideshow.jsp?mode=fromshare&Uc=14ewb3ap.b147fdut&Uy=nyvoby&Ux=1) of the hurricane and the flooding produced by a resident of the French Quarter. He rode out the storm, and was taking photos the whole time, and was there for several days afterwards. The photos from ground level are remarkable. He's pretty resentful towards the press, but I'm not really seeing anything in his slideshow that's different from what I've been seeing and hearing on CNN.
