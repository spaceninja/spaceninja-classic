Just to clarify, I didn't write [this](http://hatelife.org/view.php/name=Steve+Havelka), and I don't know who did. But I laughed pretty hard reading it.

_(For those who don't know, the "hubbub" in question is the hatelife community struggling to figure out why Steve changed hatelife back to what appears to be version 1.0 of the code - though honestly, I don't remember hatelife ever working quite like this)_

**UPDATE:** See [this post](/2004/07/hatelifeorg/) for information about the hatelife archive.
