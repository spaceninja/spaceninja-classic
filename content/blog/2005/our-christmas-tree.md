This was our Christmas tree this year. It's made out of felt, as are the ornaments, meaning that they just stick to each other without needing any glue or anything. Annie and Sean and I all made ornaments, and if you look close, you can see the spaceninja logo, dread Cthulu and assorted Tolkien imagery, as well as a couple strawberries. Annie asked me to come up with something special to top the tree, and I could think of nothing more appropriate than the ninja star Miles gave me a few years ago. I think it looks pretty good up there!
