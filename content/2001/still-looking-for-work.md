Nervousness. Still trying to get ahold of Steve's boss to find out if I have a shot at a job. I've also got three applications in with the state of Oregon, one of which is a web designer job, but it's in Salem, which means I'd have to move. That would suck, but the job pays well enough that I would do so if I got it. I'm also still awaiting word on the web design job Miles tried to set me up with. Apparently the design firm is still negotiating with the client about whether or not she wants to pay to have a web site, meaning they'd contract me to do it.

I'm sick of being out of work. It's nice having lots of time to do things like learn PHP and work on new site designs, but this not-having-money stuff has got to end.
