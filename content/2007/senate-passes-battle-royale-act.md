When I loaded up [Google News](http://news.google.com/) today, the top headline was about the Senate passing the War-Spending bill. The associated photo, however, was the logo from the Japanese film, [Battle Royale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_%28film%29), a dystopian story where the Japanese government has passed the "[Battle Royale Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale)." This law causes the military to take randomly chosen classes of high school students to an island, where they are forced to fight to the death. The secret goal of the act is to terrorize the population, theorizing that "...after seeing such atrocities, the people will become paranoid and divided, preventing an organized rebellion."
