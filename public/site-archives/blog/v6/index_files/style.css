	Probably no one will see this, but so you know, it's based on Kubrick.
	I've tweaked some of the default code, moved some things around, and
	changed some things to suit my needs. The main changes are to get the
	XHTML divs to match my modus operandi, so that it would be easier for
	me to design my blog. Kubrick was alright, but I've evolved a way of
	doing things that works for me, so now I have Dojo. Feel free to take
	it and mess around with it, there's nothing revolutionary in the HTML
	itself - the fun comes when you apply a CSS file.
