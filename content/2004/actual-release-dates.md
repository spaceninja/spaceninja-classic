this schedule is fantastic. doom 3 comes out in july, giving us a month and a half to enjoy it until half life hits and we don't care anymore. fable is right after that, but it's an rpg so it doesn't really compete for time with shooters; rather, it competes for time with life itself. this gives us a full two months to worship at the altar of half life until halo 2 hits and our loyalties become divided.

starcraft comes out after halo, which means that at some theoretical future point when we need something in addition to half life and halo, there it is. probably on sale. and gta3 3 won't be on pc or xbox for at least a year, presuming sony keeps it exclusive for awhile.

all hail valve and bungie.
