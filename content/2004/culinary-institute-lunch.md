Yesterday my parents took Annie and me to lunch at Bleu, the culinary institute restaurant. All the students have to spend a period of time working there, and my cousin Melanie is working there right now. You have to get reservations something like six weeks in advance, but it was totally worth it. Not only was the food incredible, it was really cheap. For $15, you get a full five-course lunch. All the courses are small, but by the time you're done you're just stuffed. It was awesome.

I forget exactly what everything was called, but you start out with a tiny appetizer, that was a little polenta cake the size of a silver dollar. Next you get soup (mine had a fancy French name, and it was some kind of nice thick creamy chowder). Then you have a salad (green beans and tomatoes with seasonings and a nice cheese), followed by your appetizer (shrimp in a thai curry sauce). The main course is excellent, and would cost about $30 on its own in a normal restaurant (I had a lamb shank with mashed potatoes). Finally, there's a lot of really rich desserts (I had a Paris Brest, which was like a crepe with cream filling and fresh fruit).
