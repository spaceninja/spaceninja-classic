Second Star Wars post! Hot cha cha.  
  
Last night I was dozing off and thinking about the film, when I suddenly realized that they drop a big hint as to who Anakin's father is.  
  
If I remember correctly, they claim Anakin was "just born" (kinda like Jesus) in the first movie, but my conspiracy theory senses are tingling, so I don't believe that... And now that Shmi is dead, the mystery only deepens, as there's no one else to take responsibility for spawning the little upstart. Mwu ah ah.
