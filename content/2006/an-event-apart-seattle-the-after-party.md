After dropping off our laptops at the hotel, we headed to the after-party at the Alibi Bar in Pike Place Market, thrown by Blue Flavor. It's a tiny, dark little bar, and it was really loud inside. It seemed like everyone was there, but since there were something like 200 people at the event, it can't have been the whole crowd.

Ryan and I spoke with Brian Fling from Blue Flavor, and complimented him on his mobile lecture at WebVisions. We told him how it was all anyone could talk about for a couple of weeks afterwards, and he told us about some exciting stuff they're doing with mobiles right now, which I'm going to email him for more details about later on.

I also spoke with Kevin from Blue Flavor again, who jokingly told me that Bryan was getting a big head from everyone talking about his mobile lecture (it got several mentions during the event). He told us that Bryan was looking forward to talking to Ryan and me, so it was funny that we had just bumped into him.

I asked why they chose such a dive for the party (based on the look of the bar, and the crazy homeless people outside), and he laughed and told me that the place is a total hipster hangout, and they were really excited when they got it reserved for the night.

Introduced myself to Kevin Rardin, who Ryan met at the Pre-Party, and who was a contractor for Netscape and worked on Netscape 1.0 - He later made enough money to buy himself a nice house, but avoided the big financial troubles that the dot-com millionaires ran into. Now he runs his own site, and was at the event to learn a bit more about CSS.

I spoke again (briefly) with Meyer and Zeldman, and told them that I really enjoyed their conference. I told Meyer that I thought it was great that he's a smartass (which he wasn't sure how to take, but I meant as a compliment, and told him so), since that doesn't come out in his writing - which he told me was intentional, to avoid being misunderstood or censored by people's work firewalls.

I didn't get to meet Kelly Goto, which was too bad, since she seemed really cool.

Finally, I met Jimi Hendrix. This guy in the bar looked exactly like Jimi, and was dressed up like him, complete with guitar. He was in town for the 30th anniversary of Jimi's death, visiting his grave in Renton. He was pretty cool, and we talked with him for awhile about how sad it was that San Francisco was getting all yuppi-fied, and how cool the Experience Music Project is. He took photos with all of us, and I had to promise Kevin that I would email him the photos.

After getting some dinner, we walked back down Pike Place, and I got some great long-exposure photos of the market after being shut down for the night.
