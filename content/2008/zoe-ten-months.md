Dear Zoe, Between getting sick and everything that happened around Christmas, this was one of your busiest months ever. So much so, that I'm only just now getting around to writing your December newsletter, even though it's nearly time to start on the January one. Still, I hate it when people posts excuses instead of just posting, so let's get down to business!

First of all, you were sick to some degree all month. At first, we figured you were teething, and by the time we figured out that no new teeth had actually come in, it was right in the middle of the holiday bustle. At that point, we thought you were probably just having difficulties with all the traveling and having your sleep schedule messed up. The worst was the night when your mom realized you were running a 101Â° fever. It had gone away by the next day, but when we got you into the doctor, it turned out you had an ear infection. Of course, the instant we got you diagnosed, you immediately got better. This was due to the fact that you got antibiotics and then we realized that we weren't crazy, your two top teeth had popped through. Your mood improved and you started sleeping (somewhat) better. As per usual, we just didn't notice through all the snot. So basically, by the end of the month you had just been through two teeth coming in, first ear infection, first fever, and the worst cold ever. We are SO ready for the new year!

Christmas was really busy, but in a good way. Last year, we started talking to your grandparents about the idea that we might alternate Christmases between families, or some similar plan to avoid all the crazy driving we usually do. As the holiday approached, however, we realized that even though it makes for a busy few days, that's become our Christmas tradition, and it wouldn't feel right to change that now.

Lucky for us, you're generally okay being in the car, and other than a couple of meltdowns on the freeway when you were hungry, we managed to do everything without regretting it. We started out by going over to Grandpa Ted and Grandma Annie's house to decorate the tree with your cousin Leilani. You had a great time playing with this horrible singing Frosty the Snowman doll. Everybody else cringed every time your grandma made it sing, but you started laughing and grabbing it every time.

Before we left town, there was another Christmas dinner with Eric, Jill and Gavin, another with Grandma Ted and Grandma Annie, a Christmas party with my coworkers, and KT's Christmas party, some of which you skipped because you were sleeping, and one that I skipped because I had a nasty cold.

Then we went to Eugene to see your great-grandparents, Grammy and Pop-Pop, meet your cousin Amelie, and see your other cousins, Claire, Bailey, Riley, and Leilani. Oddly, none of your boy cousins were there, but with the three baby girls and the three big girls, the party was still hopping, and there were lots of photo opportunities. The best one was laying you on the bed with Claire and Amelie, while probably five people stood around taking photos. You alternated between laying there quietly while Amelie poked you in the eye, and trying to crawl off the bed to grab a camera. It sounds horrible now that I write it down, but everyone was having fun at the time - especially all the parents with cameras.

After that, we saw your great-grandparents in Washington, starting with Great-Grandma Bev. While there, we let you play with some spaghetti (which you seemed unimpressed by) and you got a baby doll that will wet itself (which you absolutely adore). I'm hoping you never find out about the peeing part. After leaving Grandma Bev's, we went to Grum and Grumpa's house for ritual, which was nice because this is supposed to be the last year that they're going to host it, so it was neat that you got to be there.

It was getting pretty late by that point, but you were doing great, and spent most of the evening either sitting on my lap or hanging out with Grandma Amy and babbling away while people tried to speak. It would have been awkward, but you were hardly the only baby making noise, because Oskar and Milo and your other cousins were also there. Your favorite part was definitely when Great-Uncle Darby played guitar and Uncle Zach played the harp. You got very excited and flapped your arms and your eyes got real big as they played.

There's plenty more to talk about like the new teeth that finally came in, or the new tricks you've learned, or the revelation I've had recently regarding your personality, but this newsletter is already overdue enough, and I've got to save something for the January issue. Suffice to say that you're an amazing little girl, and I love watching you grow and develop.

I love you, baby girl! - Your Poppa
