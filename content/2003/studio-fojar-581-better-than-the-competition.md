Miles and Steve and I are great friends, and as a result, working with them is always easy, productive and pleasurable! ...Well, okay, that might not be entirely accurate.  
  
The truth is that working with your friends is a lot harder than working with coworkers. If one of your coworkers is being a jerk or flaking off, you might get irritated, but you can just be mad at the person and move on with your life. When it's your friend doing the same things, it can get a lot more tense, because you don't want to ruin your friendship, but you're just as upset.  
  
The good news is that all three of us came into this partnership with our eyes wide open about the realities of working with each other. This is not to say that there have been no tense moments or turbulent spots. Far from it. But when those moments come, by and large, we've been able to deal with them like professionals and not let our friendship cause us to compromise the business situation.  
  
We're just coming out of a rough patch right now (at least, it felt that way to me), and things are looking good! We've got our direction and focus back, and we're working on concrete and attainable goals. Things are flowing well, and we may have some results to show everyone sooner, rather than later!
