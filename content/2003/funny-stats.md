I was curious about why my iBook was running so slowly, so I opened up the terminal and ran "top", which is a Unix program to give you system statistics. Here's what it told me:

> Load Avg: 0.21, 0.19, 0.02
> CPU usage: 3.8% user, 5.7% sys, 90.6% idle
> PhysMem: 26.0M wired, 65.8M active, 33.5M inactive, 125M used, 2.69M free

Now, I don't claim to be a Macintosh expert, but I'm guessing the slowness has something to do with the 2.69MB of RAM free (of 128MB total). Looks like I had better order that extra 512MB RAM stick in a hurry!

However, I'm very happy with the 90% idle CPU usage! Good to know that my concerns that a 900MHz G3 processor wouldn't be fast enough were unfounded.
