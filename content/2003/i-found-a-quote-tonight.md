i found a quote tonight which i really like - i've added it to the quotes but i'll post it anyway.  
  

Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.  
\- Carl Sandburg  

  
  
  
we had a very productive band rehearsal tonight - i'm playing the fiddle less and less these days, and stepping into the accordion quite comfortably. tomorrow's show should go swimmingly (provided we don't cuss one another out on stage ;) ) .. being a bunch of reformed drunks, our rehearsals have all been a bit edgy since we stopped boozing it up in them. i am very sorry i missed zach's fight at the coliseum, though; ordinarily our rehearsals are on tuesday but this is a pretty significant show for us as a group tomorrow and our bass player's girlfriend lives in eugene and only has tuesdays off and etc etc sordid mess aaggh.  
  
bass-player ben talked me into growing a handlebar mustache. what do you think, sam elliot-style or silent-movie-villain?
