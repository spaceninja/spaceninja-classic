As I've mentioned on here before, since acheiving my goal of graduating from college, I've felt somewhat aimless. Annie and I moved to Ellensburg for awhile, which helped, because it gave me the immediate goal of getting out of Ellensburg. Then once we got back to Portland, it was finding a job and moving into our own place. With those accomplished, basically I've just been living day-to-day. That was a nice switch for awhile, but lately I've been feeling like I was just treading water.  
  
So I started asking myself what my goals for the future were. And when I sat down and seriously thought about where I wanted to be 10 years from now, there was only one real answer that suited me. I didn't want to be working for anyone else. I wanted to be working with Steve and Miles, making money doing the things that we do in our spare time. Basically, I wanted to make fojar my full-time job.  
  
Now that I had a goal again, I felt better. I had something to aim towards. However, I would never be able to acheive this goal unless I stopped waiting for things to happen for me, and start working to make them happen.  
  
The intervening steps between my realization and Steve, Miles and I starting a business are kind of boring to anyone but us. There were a lot of phone calls, a ton of cautionary conversations, many reassurances and commitments, and a few actual business meetings.  
  
But the end result is that the three of us have agreed to each do what it takes to make Studio Fojar a reality. Between the three of us, we have enough talent and experience working on internet projects to be a serious competitor in the web development market.  
  
I feel good about this. The three of us have started many projects together, and have learned a lot from working with one another. But we've never made this strong a commitment to one another before, and it's definitely making a difference.  
  
[Studio Fojar](http://www.studiofojar.com/) isn't going to happen overnight. But it is happening. Keep an eye on the website as we grow and develop!

**Edit 10/26/2005:** As it turns out, Studio Fojar didn't happen at all - and the domain is no longer under our control.
