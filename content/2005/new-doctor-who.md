I just watched the first episode of the new Doctor Who show they've been airing in Britain. Turns out a Canadian cable channel has been airing it, and it's one of the oddball channels our cable package includes. The new show is excellent. It's goofy, and the new Doctor has a very bemused attitude towards everything, sort of a "I'm smarter and more capable than anyone around me, so I might as well have a good time with it."

> **Rose:** If you're an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north? **Doctor:** Lots of planets have a north.

It actually reminds me most of Douglas Adams. Now, of course, it's been so long since I've seen anything from the original series that I need to track down some DVDs, because I've completely lost the mythology. Luckily, they're aiming for new audience members, so it's not relying very heavily on that, and it stands on its own quite well.

PS - Can you tell I'm enjoying my time off?
