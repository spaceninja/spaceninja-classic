So, here are my conclusions:

Matrix:Reloaded: **Good**

Reloaded on IMAX: **Awesome!**

I was amazed. I heard so much bad press about it, and I actually really liked it. I have absolutely no complaints about this one. It's better than the first one, and better than the second one by far.

Anyways, I'm sure there are those who will disagree with me, but if you happen to share my taste in movies, then you will likely enjoy it.

And if, by any chance, you're in Seattle, go see it on IMAX right away!
