Sometimes Killing Machines reminds me of Fight Club. When my journal scrolls off the front page, but I continue reading and replying in other people's journals, It reminds me of this quote from Fight Club: (I'm quoting from the book, which is phrased a little differently than the movie, but you should get the point)  

> "The new rule is that nobody should be the center of fight club, he says. Nobody's the center of fight club except the two men fighting. The leader's voice will yell, walking slowly around the crowd, out in the darkness. The men in the crowd will stare at other men across the empty center of the room."

  
When my journal scrolls off the front page, I feel like the leader, walking slowly around the crowd, leaving comments now and then, but leaving the focus on others.  
  
Is it true, everybody asks. Is Scott Vandehey building an army? That's the word. Does Scott Vandehey only sleep one hour a night? Rumor has it that Scott's on the road starting Killing Machines all over the country. What's next, everybody wants to know... -----
