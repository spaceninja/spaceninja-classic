I love [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/), and if I'm not careful, I can get sucked in and wind up spending hours just jumping from article to article. Tonight, while researching an upcoming post, I stumbled across the entry on [Pokey the Penguin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokey_the_penguin), which is how I found out that there is an official Wikipedia entry explaining that "[Chicago-Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style)" means "to do something without pants." I hope this helps the phrase catch on. We use it constantly around here.

The coolest thing, however, is that Wikipedia told me that [Maroon 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_5) based the name of their band on Yellow 5, "also known as Yellow Number Five, a fictional band which is best known for sharing their website with the web comic, Pokey the Penguin."

What? Awesome!

Further digging has not found anything that would contradict this. In fact, it looks like the band was originally called "Kara's Flowers," then changed to "Maroon," and then had to change again due to a name conflict. So they settled on Maroon 5. Is it possible that these guys appended the 5 to their band name because of the fake band I made up?

How cool is that? For me, that ranks right up there with the letter that Christopher Randall of Sister Machine Gun sent me requesting that Yellow Number 5 quit covering his band's song.

I should probably put the website back online. It's been homeless since Steve took it off [yellow5.com](http://yellow5.com/).
