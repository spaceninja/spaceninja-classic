Okay, I don't normally write twice in one day, especially lately (three entries all month?), but I have to write about this. I must WARN you. I just saw the scariest movie I have ever seen. I've seen some horror films, I've seen some that actually creeped me out (Seven?) but this is above and beyond all that. To begin with, it's realistic enough that part of you isn't sure that those guys behind you who were saying this film is real were lying. The film is called the Blair Witch Project. The basic idea is that three film students go to do a documentary on a local witch legend in 1994, and disappear, and a year later, their film is found. That being said, let me say this movie REALLY messed me up. I had to go watch a tape of Futurama and eat some ice cream with KT just to stop shaking. I'm not really into horror flicks, but I can appreciate some of them. I liked Seven (I was disturbed by it) but I liked it. This movie is just plain and simple the most frightening thing I've ever seen. If you're really into this kinda thing, go see it, but be prepared. In hindsight, thought I can respect how well-made it was, I wish I hadn't gone to see it. Now I'm going to go to bed and have nightmares all night. You've been warned.
