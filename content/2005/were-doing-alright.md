Just a quick post to reassure everyone that we're doing alright. We had a rough few days, but we had a lot of help from our family, and we're past the worst of it now. We're taking it easy this weekend, and then Annie's going back to work on Monday. Later on, she'll be adding a section to the big post with some more details of her experiences. Right now, she's too wrapped up in her new copy of _Katamari Damacy_ that I bought her today.

It's strange, but in this midst of this one piece of really bad news, everything else was going pretty well for us. Annie had finally worked out all the health insurance nonsense we were going through, and I've been getting a lot of work through [Aquent](http://aquent.com/). My new weblog design came online, and has been well received. I've got an interview coming up for a web production position with DEQ, and steady temp work for the next couple of weeks. And coolest of all, an illustration I did a couple years ago is appearing as part of a photomontage in the New York Times this weekend! I'll have a blog post on all of these topics soon.

Thank you for all of your well-wishes and good thoughts.
