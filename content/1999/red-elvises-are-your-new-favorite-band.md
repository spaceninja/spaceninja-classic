Wow... lots has happened. I'm really not even sure where to start... The term is almost over, which means that I've only got about six months of school left. That's a really strange concept. I've been in school practically my whole life... 17 years of school. And soon that'll all be over. On the one hand, that's a relief, to have finally made it through this. I've been getting more and more burned out on the whole concept of school. It'll feel good to finish what I set out to do, and to be done with it. But on the other hand, it's going to be weird. I mean, I've never really done anything other than be a student, and now I'm getting ready to move into the real world.

Recently, I went to go see the [Red Elvises](http://redelvises.com/) in concert with Steve and Miles. It kicked so much ass. Oh, man... These guys put on easily the best concert I've ever been to. They got everyone totally into it, and everyone was dancing and having fun. There were amazingly attractive women all over the place, and they were all after the band! The lead singer was flirting like mad, dancing with any woman who came up on stage, and actually making out with a girl in the front row at one point. ...Steve and I decided that we're going to have a band like that someday.

The next night, Steve took me to a party that a bunch of people from his martial art were throwing. He said the last party he went to with these people was crazy... He got drunk, and vaguely remembers dancing with no shirt at one point, and waking up with bite marks on his fingers. The plan was, we were going to go heckle these people, which is Steve's and my usual plan of attack at pretty much anything we end up at. We had seen a lot of these people at the Red Elvises concert the night before and developed a rather low opinion of them, because ALL they talked about was parties they threw. This would have been alright, except you could tell this was all they did, all the time. Their time was equally divided between having these crazy parties, and then talking about them afterward. It got old fast. So Steve and I show up and head to the bar. Heckling's easier when you're a little drunk. We started out with a simple shot of vodka each, and then I made us screwdrivers. We drank those, and then decided mixed drinks were for wimps, and went back for a shot of whiskey each. The whiskey was HORRIBLE. We were both making really awful faces and must have looked like absolute idiots. So we washed that whiskey shot down with another shot of vodka, by which point I was feeling a little tired of drinking (though I snuck down for another shot of vodka several hours later). This was all in a half hour. These were at least double shots in each case, because we underestimated the size of the cups we were drinking from. Needless to say, we were suddenly trashed. Much more drunk than we planned. But it was fun! Steve staggered off to the snacks table, and a man I barely knew (met him five minutes before) took me around introducing me to people. He got distracted and wandered off, but I was having fun introducing myself, so I kept doing it. Usually it went something like this:

_scott wanders up to a small group of people involved in a conversation and interrupts..._ _Scott (loudly):_ HI! My name is Scott! What's your name? _attractive woman:_ I'm \[insert name\]. We've already met. _Scott (loudly):_ I'm terrible sorry! _smiling, and shaking hands... move on to next group..._

Apparently I met everyone at the party several times. I'm horrible with names in the best of circumstances, and when drunk it was hopeless... but I was having a blast. And everyone seemed to remember me, since I was wearing my Superman shirt and being very loud. At some point people started dancing, and I ended up dancing too, and I was having fun! This is highly unusual... I don't like dancing. I even danced with a few women there, which I was very proud of, since I usually don't have the nerve to ask a woman to dance (or in this case, just walk up to a woman and start dancing with her). It's hard to tell if I was making a big ass out of myself or if everyone else was too drunk to notice. I suspect that I WAS making an ass of myself, but no one else cared. Steve says at one point I started throwing a few punches at him (playfully, not seriously), and he was surprised at how well I was responding to him, blocking his punches easily. I suspect Steve being impressed with my sudden martial arts abilities has quite a bit to do with the fact that a) he and I were VERY drunk, b) normally when he tries to punch me, I just flinch away and run, and c) he was very very drunk and not punching very fast. Also, after this happened, Steve apparently got bored of it, and tried to walk away, which is when I started following him around the room, punching him. He says I'm lucky I didn't get thrown into the fireplace. I have no memory of this.

Quite a night. Scantily clothed drunk people everywhere, attractive women dancing... It was fun. At some point, though the party started getting a little too serious... People were coupling up, and making out and losing more and more clothing, and I got a little uncomfortable (remember my girlfriend?) and we got a ride home from a very nice guy named Barnaby (I think). I woke up the next morning with muscles in my back aching like they had never been used before (apparently dancing is quite a workout). I was still drunk after sleeping for 8 hours, and my kidneys hurt. Oog. After a few days I felt much better, and decided that I need to drink less. I promised myself no more getting drunk until new years. I didn't get sick, though...

Then Annie and I started seeing a lot of movies. We went to go see the new James Bond flick (it sucked, except for the boat chase scene), _Being John Malkovich_, which was really really really strange and something entirely new in a movie, _Princess Mononoke_, which I realized I had seen before, but it still kicked a great deal of ass, _Sleepy Hollow_, which was completely awesome, and _Dogma_, which kicked so much ass I'm not even going to talk about it. Just go see it. Right now.

At some point, Annie and I also got to see _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead_, which is such an incredible play. We had just rented the movie recently, and the play was just as cool. Lots of really really good dialogue. I wish I could play the word games they play.

We spent Thanksgiving with her family, which was fun. We rode the train up to Tacoma first thing in the morning, then quickly went to one of her set of grandparent's house for dinner, then to the other grandparent's house for dessert and hanging out. Then we got up the next day and went to Seattle for dinner with my family! Unfortunately on the bus to Seattle I got very very ill, and had a generally unpleasant time, but got better enough to eat dinner still. Over the next several days, I went through just about every symptom of the flu, and I have just now succeeded in getting over the worst of it. It sucked.

Interestingly enough, we just missed the excitement in Seattle by a couple of days. It was really strange to be at home watching the news and seeing them destroy a Starbucks we had been standing in just a few days before.

And, as if all that wasn't enough recent events, yesterday I got a phone call from Khrynn! She's my penpal and one of my best friends, even though we've never met in real life and have only spoken on the phone once (well, twice now). We trade letters every month or two. She was calling to tell me that she's just gotten online and has email! So I gave her my email and web page and headed to work, where in half an hour she had already sent me 15 emails and torn through the better part of this journal! It's good to see you online, Khrynn! :)

Now, I promise I'll try to write more than once a month!
