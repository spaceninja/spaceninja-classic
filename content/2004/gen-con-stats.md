Heh - I just got this email from the guy who ran the game LAN at Gen Con. Among all the staff members who spent their spare time in the LAN, I spent the most time logged in.

> Holy Crap, you guys played a lot. Scott "Can't trust a quarterback when the ref is making a call" Vandehey came in First place with a romping 1438 minutes (24 hours). Teddy "The Chocolate Factory" Reece came second with 1174 minutes (19.6 hours). Max "The Fondue Futon Master" Poitras ties with Harold "You can't have Fondue with out a Honey Dipper" Lewin with 1168 minutes (19.5 hours). Congratulation to you all; you make me sick.

Note: The nicknames are all a reference to an inside joke that isn't worth explaining, except for the last one, which is self-explanatory.
