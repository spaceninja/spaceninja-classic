Well, we're all moved. It was crazy, and I'll post details later, along with photos. We could never have done it without the help of everyone who helped at both ends of the moves. Thank you so much everyone! Right now, I'm tired and sore from dragging things around the house all day, so I'm going to bed. More details tomorrow, after I catch up at work.
