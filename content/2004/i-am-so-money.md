. . . and you don't even know it.

Last night, I was checking out [threadless](http://www.threadless.com), perusing the selections for their $10 for 10 days sale. Sadly, the shirt I wanted, [Game-Set-Match](http://www.threadless.com/product/133.html) sold out in about 48 hours. But, much to my shock, they reprinted the blue version of [Burn](http://www.threadless.com/product/70.html), which is the shirt I wanted more than any of them, and I managed to snag the last one out of stock, in my size!!!

Plus [Permafrost Pollution](http://www.threadless.com/product/94.html).

Who's the freshest? I am!
