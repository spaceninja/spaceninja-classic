<h1>Welcome to PHPForce!</h1>

PHPForce is a place where skilled PHP developers can get in touch with the
employers who want to hire them.  Job seekers can post their resumes and
browse the job listings posted by employers, and employers can search the
online resumes to find the right worker for the job.<p>



If you're a PHP developer and you're looking for work, visit our
<a href="user.php">job seekers area</a>!<p>

If you're an employer, and you want to start listing your openings on
PHPForce or search our resumes, go to the <a href="employer.php">employer
area</a>!<p>

Be sure to read our <a href="terms.php">terms of service</a>!  It's simple
and fun and if you don't, we disclaim all responsibility for everything!
