The idea behind [Paragraph](http://www.paragraphny.com/) is pretty much exactly what I've pictured doing for tech guys. I'm sure there's a decent population of tech people who telecommute, but sometimes need a place to go work that isn't the living room. For me, this desire came out of wanting to recreate the atmosphere in the tech office from when I was a computer technician at PSU, but I think it would work well for lots of people. We provide wi-fi, desks, books, and a space to hang out, and people would come. We could probably even strike a deal with a coffee stand to set up a stand in the space to provide beverages... maybe not, though.
