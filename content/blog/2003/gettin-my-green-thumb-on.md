in the two years i've lived here, i've never once taken advantage of the nursery situated at the top of the hill outside my apt complex; that changed today. i've had a few plants around my home for as long as i can remember, sort of an homage to my older brother's intense ultra-botany. mostly just the sturdy difficult-to-kill plants, like spider plants, wandering jews, cacti and succulents, and a corkscrew pine. (note the complete lack of flowering plants, plants that smell nice, etc.)

but .. even these very slowly changing plants eventually outgrow their humble origins. so today, upon delving e'er deeper into horticulture to ameliorate their lot, and in talking with my bro, i found myself unexpectedly thrusting another hobby onto my plate.
