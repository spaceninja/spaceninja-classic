Well, after spending a good part of the day prodding Steve to do work for the KMorg upgrade, it's 9pm, and the bulk of the work left is mine, mainly consisting of updating the CSS in the skins to match the new site code.

And I feel like absolute shit. I cannot focus on this task right now, so I'm heading to bed, to resume this tomorrow on my lunch break.

I feel bad about abandoning this job half-finished, especially after pushing Steve to work on it earlier, but I just realized that I've been sitting here in front of my computer for 2 hours, and the only thing I've done is replace one variable in one file.

Time to admit defeat and just go to bed early.

Thank god tomorrow's Friday.
