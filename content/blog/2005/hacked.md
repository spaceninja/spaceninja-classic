Well, there may be some changes coming down the pipe. I didn't upgrade my wordpress installations fast enough last time, and some fuckers hacked my shell account and have been using my account to send out truckloads of spam. Luckily, the sysadmins are being really cool about it, but this is a real problem, and requires me to change passwords and rename files and directories, and do clean installs of lots of things and bleagh.

Fucking hackers.
