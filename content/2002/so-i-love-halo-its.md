So, I _Love_ Halo. It's so much fun. I even love it despite the awkward transition from keyboard/mouse to Xbox controller. It just nails everything that you should have a good first-person-shooter. There's a decent plot (half-life and deus-ex were better), it's BEAUTIFUL, it's got incredibly well-balanced weapons and enemies. On the normal settings, it's difficult without being frustrating. When you die, it loads immediatly, so you don't have to wait to respawn. It's got good voice acting (I never get tired of killing the little alien grunts, who run around screeching like monkey and scream when I throw grenades at them).  
  
In other good news, I finally got FCS version 2.0 almost finished. There's still some cleaning up to be done, but it's all cosmetic stuff. The meat of the program is all done, and I'm hoping to release it (along with a redesign of \[http://tech.fojar.com/\]) this weekend.  
  
Now I need to get back to work. Between being sick on Tuesday and the server being down on Wednesday, I'm behind on hours this week.

**Edit 10/26/2005:** The FCS project has been discontinued and the fojar domain is no longer under our control.
