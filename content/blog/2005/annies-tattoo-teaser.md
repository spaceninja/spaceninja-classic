[![Annie's Tattoo - Teaser](/images/annies-tattoo/IMG_1917.JPG "Annie's Tattoo - Teaser")](/images/annies-tattoo/IMG_1917.JPG "Annie's Tattoo - Teaser")

This weekend, while I was busy playing video games with the boys, Annie drove down to Portland to get her tattoo. She's been planning these fairy wings for years (as long as I've known her), and now they're done! Full photoset coming later, but for now, here's a teaser...

When they put a tattoo on, they put the design on tracing paper, and then transfer it to the skin, so these blue lines are just a guide for the artist to follow.

**Update:** Check out the followup post with photos of [Annie's completed tattoo](/blog/2005/annies-tattoo-completed/).
