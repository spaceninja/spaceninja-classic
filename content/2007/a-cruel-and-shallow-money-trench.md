> "The TV business is uglier than most things. It is normally perceived as some kind of cruel and shallow money trench through the heart of the journalism industry, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs, for no good reason." \-- Hunter S. Thompson, [Generation of Swine](http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/a/hunter_thompson.htm)
