I got to test my new bike stuff this morning. It's been snowing over the weekend, and last night it was really cold, so there's snow and ICE all over everything, and I have a 30+ block bike ride to work. I only crashed once, at the first intersection, as I tried to brake too quickly. Lucky for me, there were no cars to run me over. I got to work fine, and I'm glad I bought the fenders, because the sun is out now, melting the ice and leaving a layer of slush and mud all over the streets, which would otherwise have sprayed all over my back.

Also, this morning I found out that my new job does not take federal tax out of my paychecks. What the hell? So now I have to set aside one out of every four paychecks to make sure I don't owe the government money at the end of the year.

The best part of the deal is that my bosses didn't even tell me, and I specifically asked if they took tax out. Turns out they meant they remove Social Security and Medicare, but not federal, which would have left me high and dry if not for one of my coworkers casually mentioning it.
