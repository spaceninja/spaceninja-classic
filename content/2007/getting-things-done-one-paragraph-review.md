David Allen, the "personal productivity guru" featured on the cover, brings us his guide to "the art of stress-free productivity." It's a quick read, and after thinking it over for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that people reading this book will fall into one of two camps. First, there will be the people who find it revolutionary, and then there will be the people who read the book and say "Well, duh." If you're the kind of person whose desk is always covered in piles of paper, and your email inbox is overflowing with unread emails, this is the book for you. I've asked Annie to read it, in the hope that she will get some use from it. Personally, I thought some of the suggestions bordered on ridiculous, but even if you find the book to be mostly common sense, I think you'll get a few useful suggestions, so I still recommend it. _(If this book were a college course, it would be a required 100 level, and half the students would hate it.)_
