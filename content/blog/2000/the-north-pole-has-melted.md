[The North Pole Has Melted](http://slashdot.org/articles/00/08/19/0627241.shtml)

Okay, technically, that's not true. But at 90 degrees north, the pole, there is a mile-wide lake where the ice cap has melted.

I'm not sure how to react to this. On the one hand, all the scientists seems to be turning head over heels to reassure us that it could be entirely natural, and I believe that is a possibility. On the other hand, it's hard to deny the evidence supporting the global warming theory.

Sorta makes you wonder, when the smoke from the giant fires burning all over the world clears, what are we going to see? Is the habitat we live in going to be changed to something unrecognizable that quickly? Whether we're the cause or not, it's hard to ignore a mile-wide spot where the North Pole has _melted_.
