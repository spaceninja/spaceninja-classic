Holy cow. Last night, we made s'mores and I introduced our friends to the joy of making a s'more with a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup instead of a slab of Hershey's chocolate. It is absolutely delicious. So when I saw a limited-edition package of Reese's with Marshmellow in the store today, I had to buy one.

It is not the same at all. I'm in total sugar shock right now. I suspect that the marshmellow they use for the Reese's has as much in common with a real marshmellow as gasoline does with rocket fuel.
