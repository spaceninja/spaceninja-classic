It's funny, but when I first heard about this, I didn't think it would be any good. Then someone pointed out to me that J.J. Abrams is the same guy who has kept us on the edge of our seats about the monster on Lost while barely showing us anything. Cloverfield is just as well-done. Early in the movie, glimpses of the monster are rare, and always obscured by something. Rather than taking the point of view of the army, we follow a group of normal people on the street, just trying to survive, to whom the monster and the army fighting it are more like forces of nature. By the end of the movie, we get to see plenty of the monster, but get no answers about where it came from, which is appropriate, since the characters themselves wouldn't get any. Still, there are lots of details and hints throughout the movie, and I'm sure once the DVD comes out, there will be a treasure-trove of information to go through. I've heard many people complain about the cameraman, who is admittedly annoying, but I kind of liked him. He reminded me of Ed from Shawn of the Dead, always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, and he helped to break the tension. I can't recommend this movie strong enough -- make sure you see it on the big screen!
