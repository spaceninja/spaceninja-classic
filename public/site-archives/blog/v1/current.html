<br>There's a feeling that you sometimes get... The morning after a really good party. A quiet moment in the backseat of the car three hours into a car trip. Things like that. The feeling is really hard to describe. I guess if I had to put a word on it, it would be peaceful. Happiness, to a degree, but mostly peace. Like all your troubles have been lifted for a little while, leaving you completely undisturbed.

<p>It seems like you almost need to be half asleep for this, but not always. I remember lying in the backseat of a car the morning after a cool party. There were two other people in the car, but it was a quiet moment between conversations. <i>Burn</i> by Sister Machine Gun was playing, and I misheard the chorus to say "You're like a butterfly... and I'll never be the same."

<p>It mostly seems to happen after good parties, when you've just spent the entire night talking to someone cool. I remember practically floating home the morning after I met Annie at a party her brother threw. I had the guitar solo of the Sublime song <i>Right Back</i> in my head and all was right with the world.

<p>Last night, after my friends went home, I sat down on the bed and finished reading an Asimov book. While I was reading it, Annie came in and fell asleep next to me and the CD that was playing finished. I decided to go to bed and put in a Sarah Maclachlan CD. As <i>Sweet Surrender</i> came on, I was lying in bed, looking at the light clouds in the sky and thinking about how much light the city was shining in our window. I was wide awake and I felt completely at peace.

<p>Sitting on a bench at the beach, just watching the endless roll of waves.

<p>Standing on the roof of my apartment building watching fireworks go off over the cityscape spread out below my and my fellow trespassers.

<p>Lying on the grass in a section of town I'd never been in, with a girl I didn't know, looking at the stars.

<p>Wandering through the neighborhood with a high school friend several late nights, discussing nothing in particular.
