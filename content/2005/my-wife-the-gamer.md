Last night I came home to find Annie kneeling in front of the AV system like she was worshipping at an altar. She was frantically jiggling cords and mumbling swear words that my grandfather's Navy buddies would have been impressed with. The cause of the frustration was not, as you may expect, the DVD player or the Replay. She was not trying to watch TV or listen to CDs. The drama was because she couldn't get the S-Video cable for her PS2 to plug in, so that she could play Katamari Damacy.

Turns out the pins in the S-Video cable were bent (one more reason to upgrade to composite!), probably because of the cats. Once I bent them back into place, it plugged in, and she happily sat down to continue her crusade to roll up everything on the planet.

In the two weeks since I got her this console, she's nearly beaten her first game, and is working on her second. I'm so proud of her. Now, if I could just find a mod to give the Master Chief a strawberry paint job, I could probably get her playing Halo.
