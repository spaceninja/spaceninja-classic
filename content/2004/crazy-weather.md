Well, despite what the weatherman has been saying, this snow doesn't look like it's going anywhere. We've got anywhere between 1 and 6 inches, depending on where you're standing, and after the freezing rain last night, the whole city is covered with about a quarter inch of ice.

All the weathermen have been saying that the temperature is going to skyrocket up to the 40s, and then the 3 or 4 days of rain we're going to get will melt all the snow and ice right away.

Well, it's still 23 degrees out, and not raining at all. There's nothing melting here. I think we're probably in for a couple more days with this snow and ice, even if we don't get any more.

The good news is that my 60 degree apartment finally feels warm after running outside to help a neighbor push his friend's car down the alley, where it would get stuck in the snow every 10 feet. I figured I would just be out there for a few seconds, so I didn't throw my coat on. After 10 minutes, even while working hard pushing a car, I was pretty cold, and my apartment now feels like a lovely sauna. I'll have to keep that in mind next time I feel cold.
