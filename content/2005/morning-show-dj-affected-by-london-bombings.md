This (roughly) is what woke me up this morning. I've got my radio set to [The End](http://www.1077theend.com/) in Seattle, and usually just hit the off button before the DJs can say too much, but this morning it caught my attention. You'll have to forgive me if my quote isn't perfect, the banter may have gone slightly differently, but the core of the message was that they were reporting on the bombings in London, and then the guy actually took a couple minutes to let us know about all the cool features he had planned for the day that they wouldn't be able to do because they'd be bringing us news instead.

Well, I'm really sorry to hear that the terrorist attacks upset your morning program. I'm sure it wasn't part of their plan, so try not to take it personally, okay?

Jerk.
