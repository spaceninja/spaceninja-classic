The other night we were all watching _Sea Lab 2021_ on Adult Swim, and when this exchange happened, everyone in the room was dying of laughter. I actually missed some parts of this exchange because I was busy trying to breathe... So I thought I'd post it here for my own amusement.

The best part is that most of you will assume that there's some kind of background that makes this scene make sense in the larger context of the show - but you'd be wrong.

> **Quinn:** What the hell's this do?
>
> **Stormy:** Who am I, Cornelius Drebbel, inventor of the submarine?
>
> **German Sailor:** SIEG HEIL CORNELIUS DREBBEL! \[subtitle: Victory Welfare, Cornelius Drebbel!\]
>
> **Debbie:** Guys, shut up!
>
> **German Sailor:** CORNELIUS DREBBEL! \[Cornelius Drebbel!\]
>
> _The Sailor pulls out his Luger and fires randomly across the sub ten times. Bullets ricochet off the consoles and seats all around Debbie, Quinn, and Stormy, knocking over Stormy's bag of chips._
>
> **Stormy:** Hey, Jesus!
>
> **Debbie:** Oh, God!
>
> **Quinn:** Stop it!
>
> **German Sailor:** SIEG HEIL CORNELIUS DREBBEL! \[Victory Welfare, Cornelius Drebbel!\]
>
> _The sailor pauses to drop the empty magazine and load a new one, firing off another ten shots._
>
> **Stormy:** N-no, wait!
>
> **Quinn:** Stop it!
>
> **Debbie:** Ah! Ow!
>
> **Quinn:** Stop it!
>
> _Quinn sneaks up behind the Sailor and taps him on the shoulder._
>
> **Quinn:** Stop it!
>
> _The Sailor fires another shot_
>
> **Quinn:** You idiot!
>
> **German Sailor:** WAS? \[What?\]
