The first monthly LAN party went quite well, despite some scheduling difficulties. We had my xbox hooked up to the TV, and Sean's xbox hooked up to the projector. We had plenty of xbox controllers, and Daniel even brought his PS2.

We started the day out with a little DoA between David and Sean. Then Nick and Zach showed up, along with Daniel. While Nick and Zach played a little co-op _Halo 2_, we showed Daniel _Katamary Damacy_, which immediately hooked him. Then we got some six-player _Halo 2_ going on, including some good CTF matches.

Over time, people ended up coming and going. Nick and Zach had to leave around 10 or 11 because Zach had to get up early the next day, but before they left, Daniel showed us all the wonder that is _Burnout_, and we pretty much just played that for the rest of the evening while Daniel played _Katamari_ on the projector.

Lessons learned: A projector, while cool, is a poor substitute for a TV. The projection quality was really dim and blurry. This was probably a combination of ambient lighting and projecting onto our textured walls instead of a screen. It worked pretty well for getting four players on screen at once, though.

For LAN Party II, we're going to try to find somewhere that everyone can bring their computers for a proper PC fragfest to get our _Quake III_ on.

Now I need to get off the computer because Annie and Sean and I are going to drive into Seattle for the day so Sean can hit Pike Place Market.

PS - I haven't played WoW for almost three days and I think I'm having withdrawals.
