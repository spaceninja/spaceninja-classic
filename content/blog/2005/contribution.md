Apparently, I talk in my sleep. Not mumbling, either. I speak loudly and clearly, and usually it sounds like I'm talking to whoever is in the room. The other night, I announced the following:

"I've got a contribution to this fucked up world."

Annie (groggily) said "what?" to which I chuckled, and replied:

"A Shit-Master."

Yeah. I don't know either. I'm either having incredible or terrifying dreams.
