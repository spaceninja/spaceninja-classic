Ahh... I love lazy Sundays before busy weeks. I've got a big deadline at work on Monday, holiday activities with my family for Monday night, hanging out with KT on Tuesday night, the premier of Lord of the Rings on Wednesday night, and Thursday evening I'll be heading up to Annie's parents' house for the week before Christmas. I've also got work to do for Steve for [the new hatelife](http://test.hatelife.org/), another album cover for crunchpod to work on, a potential client for spaceninja, and various side projects I've been working on for awhile now.

But for now, I'm not doing any of them. It's cold, windy and rainy outside, and I've been enjoying being lazy on the couch all morning, re-reading _The Fellowship of the Ring_, and catching a lot more of the mythology than I ever have before, now that I've read _the Silmarillian_.

Oh, and speaking of Lord of the Rings, here's a hilarious link I blatantly stole from Sean's journals: [50 Reasons Why Lord Of The Rings Sucks](http://www.pointlesswasteoftime.com/film/50reasons.html).

Last night, everyone but Daniel made it over (even my mom!) to eat burritos and watch movies. _Bullit_, the Steve McQueen cop movie was good, but didn't live up to the hype, and KT told us if we wanted a good car chase, we should have rented _The French Connection_. On the other hand, [_Shaolin Soccer_](http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/comedy/shaolinsoccer/shaolinsoccer.html) and [_Duel to the Death_](http://www.kfccinema.com/reviews/swordplay/dueltothedeath/dueltothedeath.html) totally exceeded my wildest expectations. _Shaolin Soccer_ is goofy and completely out of control, with suprisingly cool special effects that kept us all laughing the whole time. It doesn't take itself seriously at all, and even breaks into a musical at one point. As for _Duel to the Death_, we only watched a few scenes, but those scenes included ninjas on kites, ninjas that explode, ninjas that turn into hundreds of throwing stars, and even a talking severed head. Needless to say, it was awesome. We'll watch the full movie next time.
