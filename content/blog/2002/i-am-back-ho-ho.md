I am back! Ho ho yes. Victoly.

We pulled in last night at 7 am, it was a god-awful, wretched drive. I seethe with hate, with all of my blood. Heh. Well, most of it.

The Braindead Monkeys recording went well. This promises to be quite an album. Um duh I'm kind of tired and hungry. I'll post more later.

Anyway, I have some Davis peeps stayin' at my pad. Word. We should all hang out, and stuff. These are former hatelife addicts! So you know you want to meet them! Oh god!
