This weekend, we got two little black kittens! They are about three months old, very playful, and are **adorable**. We've named them Taco and Burrito, though we have a bit of difficulty telling them apart, since they're both black. Burrito has very slight striping on her belly and neck, but you have to be looking carefully in good light to tell. We're probably going to get them different colored collars in the long run. Anyways, here are a few photos and a video of them playing in the bathtub.

[![Cat Box, Help You.](/images/kittens/IMG_2957.jpg 'Photo Sharing')](/images/kittens/IMG_2957.jpg 'Photo Sharing') Bringing the kittens home, we put them both in a carrier in the back seat, but they were unhappy. They kept mewing and sticking their little paws out the air holes, and I couldn't resist the cuteness. In the end, I held the carrier in my lap for two hours, with one corner open, so they could stick their heads out and see what was going on.

However, being kittens, they have lots of energy, and within just a few moments of me opening the box, they had jumped into the bathtub and decided it was a wonderful place to play tag.

It's cute, but you should be warned that the video file is **13.1 Megabytes** and will take forever to download if you don't have broadband.
