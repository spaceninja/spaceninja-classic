Hi everyone, Just a quick informal survey. When you read a blog, do you enjoy it covering two unrelated topics or would you rather see the author publish two blogs, one for each topic?

Specifically, what I’m thinking of is that my blog is pretty evenly divided right now between posts about web development and personal posts, and that will only get more noticeable once I’m posting baby photos all the time. Do you think I should spin it off into a work blog and a personal blog, or leave them rolled into one?

Everyone who is reading this, please take a quick second to comment with your preference.
