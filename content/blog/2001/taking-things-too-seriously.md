Some people take things too seriously. It always amazes me when I see how stressed out people get over the smallest things in their lives. It's like "HEY! You're alive! You've got friends! You've got food to eat and a roof over your head! Lighten up!" But of course, I don't say stuff like that to people, because I'm a big fscking hypocrite. :)

On a completely unrelated note, our first radio show went amazingly well. I was pretty nervous when we got into the studio, but by a half hour into the show, I felt 100% better. We still have plenty of room to improve, but WE CAN DO IT, which I wan't entirely sure of, before. This show is going to rule. Next project: Fliers and a website for it.

Computer status: Annie's is still toast, as I've found no time yet where I could get Urn to help me without getting him in trouble. ;) My computer is working fine, despite the complete and total lack of all my graphics files. :(

Jester contacted me, and the themes have been approved with one final revision to be made, which I'll have to do tonight. Then, as soon as they get the installer made, they'll post it on the website. Hooray!

Also, I need to start making new [hammerspace](http://hammer.spaceninja.com/) strips. I've got a bunch of ideas. :)
