> "So I assure you I won't be pursuing any kind of legal action against Mojo. At least not for sexual harassment. I _am_ considering some form of a "Cease And Desist" order to stop him from handing me business cards all day. _"I don't **need** these,"_ I scream, _"these are **my** cards!"_. This is usually countered by a couple seconds of mock-thinking, followed by another business card. Then, later on, when I'm crying out of frustration, maybe a butt-pat." \-- Kevin Cornell, referring to [Mojo](http://www.bearskinrug.co.uk/_articles/2006/04/21/the_coffee_break/), his cartoon sock monkey coworker.
