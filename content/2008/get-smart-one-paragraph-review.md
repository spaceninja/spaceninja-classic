Since I'd never watched the TV show, I wasn't sure what to expect from the movie. On the other hand, I figured it's Steve Carell doing a slapstick spy movie, which is right up my alley. Thankfully, it turns out to be really funny. Maxwell Smart is an analyst working for CONTROL, a top-secret spy agency. Max dreams of becoming a field agent and getting away from his boring desk job. He gets his wish when the identities of all existing agents are exposed, and they're forced to put Max in the field. Surprising, a lot of the funniest bits of the movie happen back at CONTROL headquarters, where the remaining agents have been turned into analysts. Mirroring Max's struggles in his new role, the agents have difficulty adapting to office culture, struggling with their computers and fighting over the copy machine. (Prompting Alan Arkin to yell at them, "That's CIA crap!") I think a lot of people will come into this movie expecting "the Office with spies" and will walk out disappointed. Still, if you are willing to let this movie do what it does best -- poke fun at the spy genre -- then I think you'll really enjoy it.
