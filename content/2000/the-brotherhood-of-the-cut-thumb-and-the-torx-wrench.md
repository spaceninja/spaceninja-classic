Ha ha! I might be getting out of retail and joining the Brotherhood of the Cut Thumb and the TORX wrench...

Wait. Let me back up.

On Wednesday, November 15th, I got a call informing me I was hired at The Computer Store. I commenced to work my retail position on the 20th...

After nine days of doing little besides answering the phones, while watching the computer's service (repairs) department drowning in work, I received an email from the service manager looking for anyone who could fill the gap.

I fired off a resume and within 10 minutes he showed up and promised to talk to my manager and her manager and see if we could work something out.
