Huh. That's weird. I made a post here yesterday about GenCon and how much fun I was having, and it seems to have spontaniously deleted itself. Fun.

**I kicked Boba Fett's ass.**

Daniel Logan, the kid who played young Boba Fett in the Star Wars movies was here signing autographs, and he came over and played Halo with us for a few hours in the game LAN. He was a lot of fun to play with, and he traded Yahoo accounts with us all so we could meet up to play online together.
