We just had an 3.1 earthquake! I felt one strong shake, as if something had hit the house. I went to the window, wondering if our downstairs neighbors had backed their truck into the side of the house, and heard everyone outside talking.

- `<scott>` What was that?
- `<neighbors>` Earthquake! Did you feel it!
- `<scott>` \*laughing\* Yeah! I thought you guys had hit the house or something!
- `<neighbors>` We thought you did it! We were like "What are they doing up there?"

Can you tell we don't get many earthquakes around here?
